          "body": "### **Summary**\n\nOn February 14, 2024, between 20:05 UTC and 23:03 UTC, Atlassian customers on the following cloud products encountered a service disruption: Access, Atlas, Atlassian Analytics, Bitbucket, Compass, Confluence, Ecosystem apps, Jira Service Management, Jira Software, Jira Work Management, Jira Product Discovery, Opsgenie, StatusPage, and Trello.\n\nAs part of a security and compliance uplift, we had scheduled the deletion of unused and legacy domain names used for internal service-to-service connections. Active domain names were incorrectly deleted during this event. This impacted all cloud customers across all regions. The issue was identified and resolved through the rollback of the faulty deployment to restore the domain names and Atlassian systems to a stable state. The time to resolution was two hours and 58 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nExternal customers started reporting issues with Atlassian cloud products at 20:52 UTC. The impact of the failed change led to performance degradation or in some cases, complete service disruption. Symptoms experienced by end-users were unsuccessful page loads and/or failed interactions with our cloud products.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nAs part of a security and compliance uplift, we had scheduled the deletion of unused and legacy domain names that were being used for internal service-to-service connections. Active domain names were incorrectly deleted during this operation.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. The detection was delayed because existing testing & monitoring focused on service health rather than the entire system’s availability.\n\nTo prevent a recurrence of this type of incident, we are implementing the following improvement measures:\n\n* Canary checks to monitor the entire system availability.\n* Faster rollback procedures for this type of service impact.\n* Stricter change control procedures for infrastructure modifications.\n* Migration of all DNS records to centralised management and stricter access controls on modification to DNS records.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\n‌\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Customers' user search results failed or were delayed as Atlassian's service returning user search results was degraded in several regions.\n\nThe incident originated from a computationally intensive operation that was triggered multiple times in rapid succession, resulting in degraded performance of Atlassian's user search service across several regions. Notably, customers in the EU west region were most affected. The incident was detected within 2 minutes by automated monitoring, and our team promptly took action by recovering unhealthy systems and scaling up the service's infrastructure temporarily. The resolution process concluded in 3 hours and 06 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between Dec 18, 2023, between 12:29 p.m. UTC and Dec 18, 2023, 3:35 p.m. UTC. The Incident caused service disruption to cloud customers worldwide. Customers experienced delayed or failed user searches when using the following Atlassian cloud products:\n\n* Atlas\n* Bitbucket Cloud\n* Compass\n* Confluence Cloud\n* Jira Service Management\n* Jira Software\n* Jira Work Management\n* Jira Product Discovery\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident stemmed from Atlassian's user search service receiving commands to process multiple computationally intensive operations in rapid succession. These operations were directed at the same customer data set, and therefore overloaded resources within a clustered database system, leading to memory exhaustion and subsequent unresponsiveness to user search requests. \n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nTo prevent a recurrence of such incidents, we are implementing the following measures:\n\n* Implement a mechanism to queue computationally intensive operations in order to avoid overloading the resources within the systems and process them without impact on customer experience.\n* Fine-tune our clustered database settings to mitigate the impact of resource exhaustion on the overall system. \n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were affected during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the service’s resiliency.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

On July 6, 2023, from 03:52 to 15:11 UTC, we experienced an issue with an upgraded version of a third-party tool that functions as our internal artifact management system. Despite our monitoring system identifying the incident within two minutes, this issue led to the degradation of the scaling capabilities of our internal hosting platform, resulting in service degradation or outages for customers of Atlassian cloud.\n\nIn response to this situation, we are taking immediate measures to enhance the stability of our system and prevent similar issues from re-occurring.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThis incident affected multiple regions and products due to the diminished scaling capabilities of our internal hosting platform. In most products and offerings, customers faced reduced functionality, slower response times, and limited access to specific features.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe root cause of the incident was the introduction of new functionality in a third-party tool that functions as our internal artifact management system. It led to an unexpected increase in the load on the primary database of the artifact system.\n\nUpon identifying and localizing the problem, we promptly adjusted the system configuration to regain stability.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nOver the next months, we will enact a temporary freeze on non-critical upgrades of the artifact management system, and we will focus our efforts on three high-priority initiatives:\n\n1. **Enhancing system scaling:** We prioritized work ensuring that downtime in a critical infrastructure component does not affect the scaling of other components. We expect to complete this initiative within the next two months.\n2. **Reducing interdependencies:** We are working to mitigate the risk of potential cascading failures by ensuring that significant system components are able to operate independently in the case of issues. Initiatives 1 and 2 are already in progress but have been given priority to be completed as soon as possible.\n3. **Strengthening testing procedures:** Alongside these initiatives, we are addressing the need for even more stringent testing procedures than we already have in place to prevent potential issues in future updates. We are committed to collaborating closely with our technology partners to ensure the most optimal experience for our customers.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience caused by this incident and appreciate your understanding. Our team is dedicated to continually improving our systems and processes to provide you with the exceptional service you deserve. Thank you for your continued support and trust in us.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
