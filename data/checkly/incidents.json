          "body": "On May 1st, 11:15 pm UTC a buildup in memory usage in our check scheduling service started. It was caused by a user creating an extremely high number of client certificates for their checks. Over time, this caused the scheduler instances to crash until almost no checks could be scheduled from ~11 pm - 1 am UTC.\n\nAfter an initial investigation, the on-call engineer decided to declare an incident and scale up the scheduling service to handle the high memory consumption. \n\nThis partially restored service, but was not enough for full recovery. Memory usage was increasing very quickly and still causing crashes which caused some check runs to get lost. Check scheduling was still significantly impaired.\n\nAfter investigating using logs, metrics, and events stored in our data lake, we were able to identify an account with an extremely high number of client certificates. The check scheduling service executed a database query through an implicit model dependency for every check run job, which loaded all certificates into memory, leading to high memory consumption. \n\nThe incident was fully resolved when we enforced a hard limit of 10 certificates per account. The limit brought back the scheduling service' memory consumption to regular levels. After fixing the memory issues, we manually scaled up the platform to handle the build-up of queued check runs, and within ~30 minutes, the service returned to normal around 5:30 am UTC. \n\nHow we move forward:\n\n1. We have limited the amount of certificates users can create to 10 and the size to be max 50kb. Thereby preventing the same issue from happening a second time. \n2. We are adding tooling to investigate the heap usage of our NodeJS services so we can debug memory problems much faster if scaling up does not resolve them. Our current methods have proven insufficient under pressure in an incident situation. \n3. We are currently reviewing all APIs to make sure we have proper limits in place for other entities as well.",

This incident impacted approximately 37,600 browser and multistep checks, with the maximum delay reaching 44.5 minutes. API checks and heartbeat checks remained unaffected. All delayed checks were eventually processed. We didn’t detect any signs of false positives caused by this incident. \n\n### Root Cause\n\nSuspicious activity within one customer’s accounts generated over 21,000 additional browser check runs in a short period of time, saturating the `us-east-1` region's capacity and causing the delays.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience and assure you that all delayed checks were executed without any false positives. Checkly is committed to providing a reliable service and we are taking steps to enhance our resilience and security.\n\n### Support\n\nFor questions or concerns, please contact [support@checklyhq.com](mailto:support@checklyhq.com). We value your trust and are here to help.",

The lack of proper internal communication about the system's state and rollback led to confusion and a prolonged response even more.\n\n### The incident affected browser checks in two specific cases:\n\n1. When using Twilio in any runtime - due to `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` environment variable being improperly escaped. Affected check runs failed with an error message: `accountSid must start with AC`\n2. Checks using `mocha` in runtimes 2022.02 and 2022.10 with Playwright. These checks failed with an error `Could not load reporter /checkly/functions/src/browser-check-common/src/mocha/reporter.js`: \n\n### Impact:\n\n* A total of 10 customers were affected.\n* A total of 120 browser check runs \\(0.5%\\) failed due to this incident.\n* A total of 66 different checks were affected.\n* The broken deployment was shipped at 15:30 and was rolled back at 16:10 UTC\n\nWe apologize for any problems this may have caused. **If you have any questions or concerns feel free to contact us via** [support@checklyhq.com](mailto:support@checklyhq.com)",

Affected customers have been directly notified, and the alerting is again working as expected.\n\nCheckly’s SSL alerting is an older, rarely changed feature. Unlike other alerts, it does not go through our regular AlertingService, which is actively monitored through metrics like number of alerts sent or failed and similar. Instead, SSL alerting is based on a daily scheduled job that is monitored with a heartbeat check only. On Dec 12, 2023 - a regression was introduced to the SSL alerting job that caused the job to fail sending alerts, but without throwing an error. Since we only alerted based on job success until now, this was not caught by our monitoring and went unnoticed until March 5, 2024, when support reported a missing SSL alert to the engineering team. \n\nWe are reviewing our entire monitoring for all Checkly alerting currently to make sure we do not have other such blindspots for older alerting features. SSL alerting will now be actively monitored and alerted by metrics such as number of alerts sent rather than just by tracking job success or failure. That way we can prevent such a high time to detect moving forward.",

This incident led to a loss of metrics and logs for our runtime environments.\n\n**Customer Impact**: After an analysis of our database records, we concluded that customer checks remained unaffected during this period.  \n\n**Root Cause**: The issue was traced back to a recently released version of a monitoring dependency that introduced a breaking change. This incident was amplified by the absence of version pinning in our configuration.\n\n**Resolution and Prevention**: To address this issue and prevent similar occurrences in the future, we have implemented version pinning for our observability dependencies.

The alert was triggered because of a high scheduling delay for checks. After fixing the bug, we added monitoring for failed ECS task starts.
