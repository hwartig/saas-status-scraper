          "body": "# Incident Postmortem: Metric Drains Interrupted for Some Dedicated Stacks\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nOn June 20, 2023, our platform experienced a service degradation incident for Metric Drains while rolling out a new feature for Metric Drains. This was due to unexpected side effects of a new internal utility used to deploy the feature. Some of our customers experienced interruptions in their metric drains during this incident. All issues were subsequently addressed, and service has been fully restored.\n\n## Detailed Incident Description\n\nConfiguration Change Initiation: The rollout of the change relied on a two-step configuration process to update the software for the metric drain emitter and aggregator components within each dedicated stack. This process was initiated using a new utility that had been successfully deployed in the past but not at the scale required for this rollout.\n\nUtility Timeouts and Delays: During the rollout, the configuration utility started experiencing cascading timeouts as operations queued with increasing delays in executing the configuration changes. During this period of delay in having configuration uniformly updated for the rollout, this caused some customer stacks to be only partially configured for the updated metric drain software.\n\nCustomer Impact: A small number of customers who were deploying or scaling services during this period had their metric drains interrupted due to the aforementioned configuration issues.\n\nResolution: Our team immediately worked on fixing the configuration issues. By 16:24 EDT, we successfully restored the configuration state for the affected customers, and the service was resumed to its regular state.\n\nFollow-up Audit: On the following morning of June 21, a follow-up audit revealed that two additional customers still needed configuration updates for their metric drains. We immediately addressed these issues.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe root cause of this issue was a combination of the increased scale of the rollout and the relative novelty of the utility used for the configuration changes. Although this utility had performed successfully under previous workloads, it did not sufficiently scale to handle the increased demand of this particular rollout.\n\n## Lessons Learned and Preventative Measures\n\nTesting Deployment Tools at Scale: testing new deployment tools and utilities under maximum practical loads is crucial to ensure they can handle expected full-scope workloads without disruption.\n\nAudit Processes: Though our follow-up audit process effectively identified additional affected customers, we will make such audits more timely to catch any lingering issues sooner.\n\nWe sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused to our customers during this incident. We take this issue seriously and are committed to ensuring that such incidents do not occur in the future.",

The nature of the vulnerability has not been disclosed, but based on how it's being handled, Aptible expects it could be a serious vulnerability affecting data confidentiality for those running affected OpenSSL versions (>= 3.0.0, < 3.0.7).\n \nAptible has reviewed all infrastructure components that we manage and have confirmed that all are unaffected by this vulnerability. These components include:\n\n- Our Managed TLS endpoints\n- The TLS endpoints for our REST API services (Auth and Deploy APIs)\n- All versions of our managed databases\n- Our log forwarding infrastructure\n- Our metrics collection infrastructure\n- Our SSH and Git server infrastructure\n\nStill, every Aptible customer should check the OpenSSL versions used in their apps to confirm they're unaffected. To do so, run:\n\n$ aptible ssh --app $APP_HANDLE openssl version\n\nIf the version is >= 3.0.0, you should plan to upgrade your apps' Docker image(s) tomorrow as soon as OpenSSL 3.0.7 is released.\n\nWe will continue to update this incident page as more information is revealed about the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is only exploitable for *server-side* OpenSSL functionality, the impact to Aptible customers would be significantly reduced. Only those customers who use plain TCP endpoints [1] with their own OpenSSL for TLS termination would be affected in this scenario.\n\n[0] https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2022-October/000238.html\n[1] https://deploy-docs.aptible.com/docs/tcp-endpoints",

The issue has been resolved and the service is operating normally.\n\nSeptember 27th, 2021: \\(Only a couple of Endpoints were impacted, so no incident was created\\)\n\n> On September 27, 2021, between 8:45 AM and 2:09 PM PDT, Route53 experienced increased change propagation times for Health Check edits where unexpected failover to their secondary application load balancer \\(ALB\\) occurred despite their primary ALB targets being healthy. The issue has been resolved and the service is operating normally.\n\nWhile AWS describes these incidents as \"increased change propagation times\", \"intermittent failures\", and \"increased packet loss\", and apparently do not qualify as an incident to be posted to [https://status.aws.amazon.com,](https://status.aws.amazon.com,) the observed impact to our customers is very clear: the impacted Endpoints are totally unreachable for a period.\n\nAs such, we will permanently implement the \"temporary\" change we made on October 15th: we will be disabling the Route53 health checks \\(and the associated custom error page\\) for all Endpoints, as this has been the root cause of these availability incidents.\n\nAs we indicated to customers during the Oct 15th and Nov 3rd incidents, you may restart any App in order to immediately disable the Route53 health check. Any App which has been deployed, restarted, or scaled since October 15th will already have it disabled, and we will make another announcement when we intend to disable it globally on all Apps for which it remains enabled.",

We have also confirmed that the exploit we are using does not work on other versions. However, without clear guidance from Elastic, we are taking action to patch and restart **all** Elasticsearch Databases hosted on Aptible.\n\nHere's a summary of the actions we have taken and planned so far:\n\n* COMPLETED - Contact all customers with Public Database Endpoints that are exposing known vulnerable versions of Elasticsearch, and add an IP Whitelist to those Endpoints.\n* COMPLETED - Patch and restart Elasticsearch version 5.6, and versions 6.4 through 7.10 by setting \"log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true\"\n* COMPLETED - Patch and restart all other Elasticsearch versions with class replacement\n\nWe will continue to provide updates for this incident as we have more progress or information.

While Aptible Deploy is not impacted by the published exploits, we will still be taking steps to prevent any potential future exploits of this vulnerability.\n\nAs part of our remediation efforts, we will be restarting all App, Bastion, and Build instances in shared stacks today. This will involve restarting Bastion and Build instances, which may result in a small number of operation failures and a short disruption to outbound traffic. Operations which fail due to this outage should work on retry. App restarts will be done using Aptible's zero-downtime release process [1]. As a result, you should not see any impact from these restarts.\n\nNotifications for the patching schedule for dedicated stacks will also be sent out today (July 16). \n\n[0] https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22555\n[1] https://deploy-docs.aptible.com/docs/releases",

These credentials consisted of:\n• a GitHub access token associated with a read-only robot user\n• a robot user password for pushing Docker images to Quay.io\n• a robot user password for deploying apps on Aptible Deploy\n\nWe audited all access on Aptible Deploy and Quay, and confirmed the compromised robot user passwords were not used in either service. On April 22, with assistance from GitHub, we identified that the GitHub token *was* used to download several repos. We audited all credentials and confidential data contained within these repos. Importantly, no customer-owned data are stored in any of our code repos, and no customer-owned data were accessed or impacted by this incident.\n\nAt this time, the only potentially compromised data is a list of companies (not individual users) who use Aptible Deploy and/or Comply. No sensitive or regulated information had been committed to the downloaded repos at any time. We will provide updates if we discover any new information, but based on our investigation thus far, we are resolving this incident.\n\n[0] https://about.codecov.io/security-update/\n\nNotes:\n• Edited April 29 to clarify that no customer-owned data were impacted by this incident",
