          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn Sep 13, 2023, between 12:00 PM UTC and 03: 30 PM UTC, some Atlassian users were unable to sign in to their accounts and use multiple Atlassian cloud products. The event was triggered by a misconfiguration of rate limits in an internal service which caused a cascading failure in sign-in and signup-related APIs. The incident was quickly detected by multiple automated monitoring systems. The incident was mitigated on Sep 13, 2023, 03: 30 PM UTC by the rollback of a feature and additional scaling of services which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 3 hours & 30 minutes.\n\n‌\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between Sep 13, 2012, 12:00 PM UTC and Sep 13, 2023, 03: 30 PM UTC on multiple products. The Incident caused intermittent service disruption across all regions. Some users were unable to sign in for sessions. Other scenarios that temporarily failed were new user signups, profile retrieval, and password reset. During the incident we had a peak of 90% requests failing across authentication, user profile retrieval, and password reset use cases.\n\n‌\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused due to a misconfiguration of a rate limit in an internal core service. As a result, some sign-in requests over the limit received HTTP 429 errors. However, retry behavior for requests caused a multiplication of load which led to higher service degradation. As many internal services depend on each other, the call graph complexity led to a longer time to detect the actual faulty service.\n\n‌\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are continuously improving our system's resiliency.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Audit and improve service rate limits and client retry and backoff behavior.\n* Improve scale and load test automation for complex service interactions.\n* Audit cross-service dependencies and minimize them where possible related to sign-in flows.\n\n‌\n\nDue to the unavailability of sign-in, some customers were unable to create support tickets. We are making additional process improvements to:\n\n* Enable our unauthenticated support contact form and notify users that it should be used when standard channels are not available. \n* Create status page notifications more quickly and ensure that for severe incidents, notifications to all subscribers are enabled.\n\n‌\n\nWe apologize to users who were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s reliability and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The incident was detected immediately by our internal monitoring and fully resolved within 15 minutes by reverting the change.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nCustomers who were impacted were unable to access the [Bitbucket | Git solution for teams using Jira](http://bitbucket.org/) website during the duration of the incident. APIs, Bitbucket Pipelines, and Git over HTTPS and SSH were fully functional.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident was caused by a bug that made it into our production environment. This bug affected our ability to communicate with our caches and prevented some of our internal services from starting up to serve traffic to our website. This bug has been fixed and deployed to production.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating these types of incidents in the future and reduce recovery time:\n\n* Improve testing in non-production environments\n* Enhance monitoring around service deployments\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn JUL 13, 2023, between 13:48 and 16:05 UTC, Atlassian customers using Bitbucket Cloud were experiencing degraded performance for git operations. The event was triggered by a bug that was deployed to production. The changes included the introduction of a bug that bypassed a critical cache for git operations which impacted all Bitbucket Cloud customers. The incident was detected within 10 minutes by automated monitoring and mitigated by rolling back the code changes and the redeployment of some services which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 2 hours & 17 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between JUL 13, 2023, 13:48 UTC and JUL 13, 2023, 16:05 UTC on Bitbucket Cloud products. The Incident caused service disruption to all customers where they experienced slow response times or failures when interacting with repository data. As a result of network saturation causing connections to queue, customers experienced increased latency and error rates across Bitbucket Cloud services.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a change to a feature flag that contained a bug which bypassed a critical cache. As a result, more requests were directly accessing the disks which led to increased latency and eventually, degraded the performance of some operations.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the impact was subtle and took approximately 48 hours to surface after initial deployment. This slow ramping was not picked up by our automated continuous test scripts because it requires significant load to reach the tipping point where systems start to become degraded.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Alerting on cache hit/miss rates\n* Improving the monitoring of network saturation for connections to our disks\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\n‌\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn July 13, 2023 between 4:04 AM UTC and 6:42 AM UTC, Atlassian customers using Bitbucket Cloud were unable to retrieve a list of branches. The event was triggered by a change in the rate limiting for that endpoint, causing them to be applied globally. The incident was detected within 5 minutes by automated monitoring and mitigated by reverting the change responsible which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 2 hours & 38 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nEverywhere in Bitbucket Cloud that retrieved a list of repository branches was affected which includes the pull request creation pages and API as well as pipelines builds. The total time that customers experienced this impact was approximately 2.5 hours.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a change to the repository branches list endpoint. As a result, users making calls to retrieve their list of branches received HTTP 429 errors. More specifically a change to the branches list endpoint caused the endpoint to incorrectly apply the repository level rate limit globally. The root cause of the incident was the failure in the detection of the bug by the deployment validations.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the change was related to a very specific kind of legacy case that was not picked up by our automated continuous deployment suites and manual test scripts.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Prevent rate limiting from being able to be applied globally\n* Remove these rate limits from generic rules\n\nTo minimize the impact of breaking changes to our environments, we will implement additional preventative measures such as:\n\n* Standardized way of disabling rate limiting to decrease time to resolution\n* Improved testing\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

On July 6, 2023, from 03:52 to 15:11 UTC, we experienced an issue with an upgraded version of a third-party tool that functions as our internal artifact management system. Despite our monitoring system identifying the incident within two minutes, this issue led to the degradation of the scaling capabilities of our internal hosting platform, resulting in service degradation or outages for customers of Atlassian cloud.\n\nIn response to this situation, we are taking immediate measures to enhance the stability of our system and prevent similar issues from re-occurring.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThis incident affected multiple regions and products due to the diminished scaling capabilities of our internal hosting platform. In most products and offerings, customers faced reduced functionality, slower response times, and limited access to specific features.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe root cause of the incident was the introduction of new functionality in a third-party tool that functions as our internal artifact management system. It led to an unexpected increase in the load on the primary database of the artifact system.\n\nUpon identifying and localizing the problem, we promptly adjusted the system configuration to regain stability.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nOver the next months, we will enact a temporary freeze on non-critical upgrades of the artifact management system, and we will focus our efforts on three high-priority initiatives:\n\n1. **Enhancing system scaling:** We prioritized work ensuring that downtime in a critical infrastructure component does not affect the scaling of other components. We expect to complete this initiative within the next two months.\n2. **Reducing interdependencies:** We are working to mitigate the risk of potential cascading failures by ensuring that significant system components are able to operate independently in the case of issues. Initiatives 1 and 2 are already in progress but have been given priority to be completed as soon as possible.\n3. **Strengthening testing procedures:** Alongside these initiatives, we are addressing the need for even more stringent testing procedures than we already have in place to prevent potential issues in future updates. We are committed to collaborating closely with our technology partners to ensure the most optimal experience for our customers.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience caused by this incident and appreciate your understanding. Our team is dedicated to continually improving our systems and processes to provide you with the exceptional service you deserve. Thank you for your continued support and trust in us.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The incidents were detected immediately by our internal monitoring and fully resolved within one hour for the initial incident and two hours for the second incident.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nCustomers who were impacted were unable to access the [bitbucket.org](http://bitbucket.org) website, APIs, Pipelines, and Git over HTTPS and SSH during the following times:\n\n* All Bitbucket services were impacted on June 2, 2023 between 00:07 UTC and 00:49 UTC_._ Website and API requests recovered after 7 minutes, while Git operations were not fully operational until 00:49 UTC.\n* All Bitbucket services were impacted on June 6, 2023 between 06:25 UTC and 08:19 UTC. Git operations recovered at 07:41 UTC. Website and API traffic recovered briefly from 07:16 UTC to 08:06 UTC but experienced additional instability from 08:07 UTC to 08:19 UTC.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nBoth incidents were triggered by database cluster restarts. The June 2, 2023 incident was caused by a bug in the version of our database engine. The June 6, 2023 incident was caused by a maintenance patch being applied to all nodes in our database cluster.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating these types of incidents in the future and reduce recovery time:\n\n* Enhance safeguards around patch application on the database\n* Improve how our services recover from database failures\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn May 15, 2023, between 02:36 and 04:08 UTC, Atlassian customers using Bitbucket, Confluence, Jira Align, Jira Service Management, Jira Software, Jira Work Management, Jira Product Discovery, and Atlas products with services hosted in the us-west-1 region were impacted by an incident related to the storing and retrieval of data assets, including media, attachments and build artifacts.\n\nThe event was triggered by a network migration of an internal service as part of an initiative to increase security by hardening partitions between network segments. The incident was detected within three minutes by automated monitoring and mitigated by a rollback of the change which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour and 32 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe impact across products was:\n\n* Bitbucket - Bitbucket Pipelines self-hosted builds were failing, access to Git LFS failed and cloud-hosted builds were delayed.\n* Confluence, Jira Align, Jira Service Management, Jira Software, Jira Work Management, Jira Product Discovery, and Atlas - media capabilities \\(images, videos, documents, audio\\) were affected and it was not possible to upload, download or view existing media attachments or files.\n\nThe service disruption lasted for one hour and 32 minutes between May 15, 2023, 02:36 and May 15, 2023, 04:08 UTC and caused service disruption to customers with services hosted in the us-west-1 region.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an attempted migration of a service to a new network segment. As part of this migration, a DNS record pointing to the old network segment was not updated, which resulted in failure when the old network stack was removed. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified as moving services across network segments is not a regular activity and is difficult to accurately replicate in a test environment. To mitigate against these types of issues, we made this change using blue/green deployment practices but failed to run adequate verification steps before decommissioning the old stack.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Reviewing our systems that decommission service stacks and implementing checks that customer traffic is no longer being served prior to decommissioning the stacks; and\n* As part of our service network migration process, we are adding steps to identify when there are associated DNS records that require attention.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn February 2, 2023, between 9:00 AM and 10:30 AM UTC, Atlassian customers using the Bitbucket Cloud experienced degraded performance and timeouts of the website. The event was triggered by a feature flag configuration that created an unexpected load on core infrastructure. Customers across all regions were affected. The incident was detected within 10 minutes by automatic monitoring and mitigated by disabling the feature flag and scaling up the number of website servers, which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour and 30 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between 9:00 AM and 10:30 AM UTC on February 2, 2023, on Bitbucket Cloud. The Incident caused service disruption to customers in all regions where they experienced slow website response times and website requests timing out. This affected users' ability to use Bitbucket Cloud through the web user interface, including functions such as viewing and merging pull requests, viewing commits and files in Git repositories, and viewing the dashboard.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused when a feature flag was enabled with a higher-than-anticipated evaluation cost. The feature flag was only enabled for an internal team, but the method used to evaluate that condition resulted in an increased load on each server. That increased load caused slower request times, and as we were operating at our peak listed server capacity, we ultimately ended up queuing requests which is when customers started seeing timeouts and errors instead of just slow requests. Manually scaling up the servers allowed us to spread that load out and serve requests without queuing until we found the cause and disabled the inefficient evaluation of the feature flag.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the change was related to causing an increase in website's CPU load that was not picked up by our automated continuous deployment suites and manual test scripts.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* We have changed how we evaluate feature flag configuration so that high-volume feature flag evaluation doesn't increase the load on the website service. \n* We have doubled the maximum available capacity to allow for the website auto-scaling to absorb additional load caused by any performance-impacting changes\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn December 16, 2022, between 10:07 and 15:40 UTC, Atlassian's internal artifact management infrastructure experienced an outage. Some Atlassian customers using Bitbucket Pipelines, Marketplace apps and integrations, and managing attachments across Atlassian cloud products were impacted. Bitbucket users experienced failures of Bitbucket pipelines and Bitbucket pipeline runners, Marketplace apps and integrations users experienced missing webhooks, and actions on attachments \\(especially uploads\\) were impacted across all our products. The event was triggered by Atlassian's internal Artifact Repository Manager becoming unavailable due to a combination of an abnormally high load and misconfiguration of rate limiting and circuit breaking. Customers in all regions were impacted. The incident was immediately detected by our monitoring systems and mitigated by changing policies and configuration, which allowed the Artifact Repository Manager to recover. The total time to resolution was about five hours and 33 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nWe detected the impact of this incident on December 16, 2022, at 10:07 UTC, recovery started at 11:00 UTC with most of the functionality restored by 12:12 UTC, and full recovery was achieved at 15:40 UTC.\n\nBelow is the breakdown of the impact for each product.\n\nMarketplace apps and integrations:\n\n* Webhooks were intermittently impacted for approximately two hours \\(10:07 UTC - 12:07 UTC\\).\n* Between 13:45 UTC and 15:40 UTC, we observed a significantly increased failure rate and drop in traffic on app discoverability \\(apps disappearing from products UI\\), app execution \\(apps execution failing\\), and developer capabilities \\(app deployment and management\\).\n\nBitbucket:\n\n* Bitbucket Pipelines rely heavily on our internal artifact management infrastructure to fetch the necessary container images during builds and were impacted for the duration of the incident.\n* We have detected approximately 60,000 build steps failures in the affected period.\n\nAll Atlassian cloud products:\n\n* Our internal attachment management infrastructure had encountered scaling issues and this intermittently affected the ability to upload/manage attachments for approximately two hours.\n* Users of Confluence, Jira Service Management, and Jira Software were unable to view or upload attachments.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an outage of Atlassian's internal Artefact Repository Manager due to a combination of an abnormally high load and misconfiguration of rate limiting and circuit breaking. As a result, the products listed above could not access Docker images and other necessary artifacts to scale up, which caused partial degradation of some services or complete unavailability of some other services for customers. The restart of the internal Artifact Repository Manager and changes in policies and configuration caused downtime to the service but led to successful recovery.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. After the immediate impact of this outage was resolved, the incident response team completed a technical analysis of the root cause and contributing factors. The team has conducted a post-incident review to determine how we can avoid the impact of this kind of outage in the future.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to minimize the likelihood of incidents of this type reoccurring:\n\n* Build redundancy into the artifact management system to increase resiliency.\n* Make changes to our internal infrastructure and affected systems to improve resiliency.\n* Improve our internal documentation for incident resolution.\n* Tweak alerting to improve the detection and TTR of similar incidents in the future.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **CONTEXT**\n\nAtlassian Cloud products, applications, the customer experiences they provide, as well as supporting services and Atlassian’s own internal tooling rely on compute and data workloads deployed in Amazon Web Services \\(AWS\\) Virtual Private Cloud \\(VPC\\).\n\nCritical to the function of these applications is the network communication between them, as well as to the Internet and AWS-managed services. This communication depends on DNS resolution, which applications perform by querying a DNS server to translate service names into network addresses they can connect to.\n\nTo facilitate DNS resolution across multiple accounts and VPCs, Atlassian operates [centralized EC2 \\(Elastic Compute Cloud\\) DNS servers](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-centralize-dns-management-in-a-multi-account-environment/) in each AWS region we serve customers from.\n\nAtlassian is currently in the process of migrating from this centralized infrastructure to a more resilient distributed solution that leverages [AWS-managed VPC resolver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#AmazonDNS) in a [Shared VPC architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9NMA3ACZDM). However, a number of internal applications and services still rely on the EC2-based solution.\n\nThe EC2-based DNS servers utilize [security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html), which are subject to [connection tracking allowance limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html)instrumented by AWS.\n\n### **INCIDENT SUMMARY**\n\nOn November 22, 2022, between 19:39 and 21:28 UTC, some Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket customers experienced varying levels of degradation across our products and services, including partner apps and integrations. The incident was detected within nine minutes by an automated monitoring system and resolved within one hour and 49 minutes.\n\nThe event was triggered by Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure within the AWS us-east-1 region encountering a network connection tracking allowance limit. Despite the fault being localized to one region, there was a global impact for customers whose data resided in us-east-1, as well as Atlassian products which have unique dependencies on that region.\n\nThe issue was initially mitigated by scaling up the DNS infrastructure, which increased the connection tracking allowance limit and returned Atlassian products to a healthy state. The underlying issue has since been resolved by a configuration change and cannot reoccur.\n\nThe incident was not caused by an attack and it was not a security issue. Atlassian customer data remains secure.\n\nWe deeply value the trust placed in Atlassian and apologize to customers who were affected by the event.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe impact occurred on November 22, 2022, between 19:39 and 21:28 UTC, for a total of one hour and 49 minutes. Some Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket customers experienced service degradation ranging from intermittent access to a complete outage. Customers experienced error pages or very slow responses in applications and browsers, as well as 5xx response codes from our APIs.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident occurred as connections through Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure reached a new daily peak due to steady traffic growth. As a result, [a limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#connection-tracking-throttling) on the number of simultaneous network connections [tracked by an AWS EC2 security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html) was encountered. Upon reaching this limit, DNS packets were dropped, meaning services were unable to resolve network addresses which resulted in application failures. Services retried their DNS queries upon receiving a SERVFAIL response or query timeout, which created even more connections - compounding the problem.\n\nDuring the incident, Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure in the AWS us-east-1 region was unable to service up to 90% of DNS resolution requests.\n\nWe were not aware of how close our infrastructure was to the security group connection tracking limit because utilization of this allowance is not currently observable.\n\nTroubleshooting took an extended period of time because EC2 network allowance packet drops \\(as a result of encountering this limit\\) [were not actively monitored](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-network-performance-ena.html) by Atlassian.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nAtlassian acknowledges that outages like this one impact the productivity and business of our customers. Since this incident:\n\n* We have deployed an immediate change to prevent traffic through Atlassian’s EC2-based DNS infrastructure from [consuming the security group connection allowance limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#untracked-connections). As a result of this change, this incident cannot reoccur.\n* We are investigating ways to improve our visibility into the utilization of AWS network allowance limits and will [monitor packet drops](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-network-performance-ena.html) due to them. \n* We are continuing our migration of internal services away from the EC2-based DNS infrastructure involved in this incident to a new, distributed architecture that is not subject to these network limits.\n\nAgain, we apologize to those customers whose services were impacted during this incident.\n\nThank you,  \nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **CONTEXT**\n\nAtlassian Cloud products, applications, the customer experiences they provide, as well as supporting services and Atlassian’s own internal tooling rely on compute and data workloads deployed in Amazon Web Services \\(AWS\\) Virtual Private Cloud \\(VPC\\).\n\nCritical to the function of these applications is the network communication between them, as well as to the Internet and AWS-managed services. This communication depends on DNS resolution, which applications perform by querying a DNS server to translate service names into network addresses they can connect to.\n\nTo facilitate DNS resolution across multiple accounts and VPCs, Atlassian operates [centralized EC2 \\(Elastic Compute Cloud\\) DNS servers](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-centralize-dns-management-in-a-multi-account-environment/) in each AWS region we serve customers from.\n\nAtlassian is currently in the process of migrating from this centralized infrastructure to a more resilient distributed solution that leverages [AWS-managed VPC resolver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#AmazonDNS) in a [Shared VPC architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9NMA3ACZDM). However, a number of internal applications and services still rely on the EC2-based solution.\n\nThe EC2-based DNS servers utilize [security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html), which are subject to [connection tracking allowance limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html)instrumented by AWS.\n\n### **INCIDENT SUMMARY**\n\nOn November 22, 2022, between 19:39 and 21:28 UTC, some Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket customers experienced varying levels of degradation across our products and services, including partner apps and integrations. The incident was detected within nine minutes by an automated monitoring system and resolved within one hour and 49 minutes.\n\nThe event was triggered by Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure within the AWS us-east-1 region encountering a network connection tracking allowance limit. Despite the fault being localized to one region, there was a global impact for customers whose data resided in us-east-1, as well as Atlassian products which have unique dependencies on that region.\n\nThe issue was initially mitigated by scaling up the DNS infrastructure, which increased the connection tracking allowance limit and returned Atlassian products to a healthy state. The underlying issue has since been resolved by a configuration change and cannot reoccur.\n\nThe incident was not caused by an attack and it was not a security issue. Atlassian customer data remains secure.\n\nWe deeply value the trust placed in Atlassian and apologize to customers who were affected by the event.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe impact occurred on November 22, 2022, between 19:39 and 21:28 UTC, for a total of one hour and 49 minutes. Some Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket customers experienced service degradation ranging from intermittent access to a complete outage. Customers experienced error pages or very slow responses in applications and browsers, as well as 5xx response codes from our APIs.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident occurred as connections through Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure reached a new daily peak due to steady traffic growth. As a result, [a limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#connection-tracking-throttling) on the number of simultaneous network connections [tracked by an AWS EC2 security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html) was encountered. Upon reaching this limit, DNS packets were dropped, meaning services were unable to resolve network addresses which resulted in application failures. Services retried their DNS queries upon receiving a SERVFAIL response or query timeout, which created even more connections - compounding the problem.\n\nDuring the incident, Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure in the AWS us-east-1 region was unable to service up to 90% of DNS resolution requests.\n\nWe were not aware of how close our infrastructure was to the security group connection tracking limit because utilization of this allowance is not currently observable.\n\nTroubleshooting took an extended period of time because EC2 network allowance packet drops \\(as a result of encountering this limit\\) [were not actively monitored](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-network-performance-ena.html) by Atlassian.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nAtlassian acknowledges that outages like this one impact the productivity and business of our customers. Since this incident:\n\n* We have deployed an immediate change to prevent traffic through Atlassian’s EC2-based DNS infrastructure from [consuming the security group connection allowance limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#untracked-connections). As a result of this change, this incident cannot reoccur.\n* We are investigating ways to improve our visibility into the utilization of AWS network allowance limits and will [monitor packet drops](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-network-performance-ena.html) due to them. \n* We are continuing our migration of internal services away from the EC2-based DNS infrastructure involved in this incident to a new, distributed architecture that is not subject to these network limits.\n\nAgain, we apologize to those customers whose services were impacted during this incident.\n\nThank you,  \nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn Oct 4th, 2022, between 7:17 AM and 8:12 AM UTC, Atlassian customers using Bitbucket Cloud were unable to access the website. The event was triggered by a configuration change that hit a bug in the envoy proxy version we are using for cluster management. [Envoy proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) is a high performance, small footprint edge and service proxy and also load balancer. The incident was detected within 14 minutes by automated monitoring and on-call engineers were immediately paged. The incident was resolved by reverting the envoy config that caused the bug to be exposed, which mitigated the customer impact, getting our website into a good state. The total time to resolution was about 55 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between 7:17 AM and 8:12 AM UTC. The incident affected the Bitbucket Cloud website preventing users from accessing the website. Bitbucket Cloud API, Git over SSH, and Git over HTTPS were not impacted by this incident.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a [bug](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/21587) in envoy proxy where it does not handle hostnames in the Redis cluster command. We deployed the envoy proxy config for a new Elasticache Redis cluster which was planned to be used by other microservices in the near future. The envoy configuration change that resulted in the envoy bug did not affect existing Bitbucket website instances, so they were not affected by the bug after the envoy configuration deployment. Instead, the bug was exposed by the envoy config that was applied to new instances that were created by the scale-up event, so our website could not scale as new instances were failing to start since they were dependent on the envoy proxy to be up and running. This caused existing instances to hit high CPU utilization, fail health checks and eventually crash since they could not keep up with the increase in traffic to the Bitbucket Cloud website.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes \\(post-deployment verification tests across all environments\\) in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the envoy proxy bug manifested itself only on newly provisioned instances of envoy proxy as part of the microservice, existing instances of the microservice were not affected by the bug.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Redeploy Bitbucket Cloud service once envoy proxy config changes are deployed and run post-deployment verification tests in our pre-production environments to prevent this incident from re-occurrence. This will also ensure our post-deployment checks can run against our new configuration just after the deployment, without waiting for our website to scale to use the new configuration.\n* Upgrade envoy proxy to the[ most recent version ](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.22.0/version_history/current)of envoy proxy that has the fix for the bug in the Redis filter.\n* Faster rollbacks for the envoy control plane service that pushes config to envoy proxy to reduce our time to recovery \\(TTR\\) in the event this occurs again.\n* Improved and faster alerting and monitoring for detecting the degradation of microservice to reduce our time to detection \\(TTD\\) in the event this occurs again.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The event was triggered when our storage vendor experienced an outage at their data center. The outage was caused by a firmware upgrade resulting in a subset of their storage clusters failing to update correctly. The incident was detected within 14 mins by our on-call SRE team and was escalated to our storage vendor who began restoring the failed nodes to bring their storage services online again. The total time to resolution was seven hours and 33 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between 01:46 PM and 09:19 PM UTC on Bitbucket Cloud. The Incident caused service disruption to some of our users, causing affected customers to be unable to access repositories via the CLI, or browse the Bitbucket Cloud website.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a firmware update to the nodes made by our storage vendor; few nodes failed to update and went down over a span of several hours. And as a result, the affected Bitbucket Cloud customers could not access their repositories and the users received HTTP 504 errors.\n\nThe root cause of the incident was the firmware update process, which did not properly update and restart all storage nodes.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages are impactful to your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific failure with the firmware upgrade process wasn't detected prior to deployment.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Implementing detection and alerting mechanism that validates each storage volume is accessible and available.\n* Working with our external vendor on preventative measures as well as improved detection on their end.\n* Implement alerting mechanism about errors that would be generated for failed firmware updates.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
