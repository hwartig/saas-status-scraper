          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn December 16, 2022, between 10:07 and 15:40 UTC, Atlassian's internal artifact management infrastructure experienced an outage. Some Atlassian customers using Bitbucket Pipelines, Marketplace apps and integrations, and managing attachments across Atlassian cloud products were impacted. Bitbucket users experienced failures of Bitbucket pipelines and Bitbucket pipeline runners, Marketplace apps and integrations users experienced missing webhooks, and actions on attachments \\(especially uploads\\) were impacted across all our products. The event was triggered by Atlassian's internal Artifact Repository Manager becoming unavailable due to a combination of an abnormally high load and misconfiguration of rate limiting and circuit breaking. Customers in all regions were impacted. The incident was immediately detected by our monitoring systems and mitigated by changing policies and configuration, which allowed the Artifact Repository Manager to recover. The total time to resolution was about five hours and 33 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nWe detected the impact of this incident on December 16, 2022, at 10:07 UTC, recovery started at 11:00 UTC with most of the functionality restored by 12:12 UTC, and full recovery was achieved at 15:40 UTC.\n\nBelow is the breakdown of the impact for each product.\n\nMarketplace apps and integrations:\n\n* Webhooks were intermittently impacted for approximately two hours \\(10:07 UTC - 12:07 UTC\\).\n* Between 13:45 UTC and 15:40 UTC, we observed a significantly increased failure rate and drop in traffic on app discoverability \\(apps disappearing from products UI\\), app execution \\(apps execution failing\\), and developer capabilities \\(app deployment and management\\).\n\nBitbucket:\n\n* Bitbucket Pipelines rely heavily on our internal artifact management infrastructure to fetch the necessary container images during builds and were impacted for the duration of the incident.\n* We have detected approximately 60,000 build steps failures in the affected period.\n\nAll Atlassian cloud products:\n\n* Our internal attachment management infrastructure had encountered scaling issues and this intermittently affected the ability to upload/manage attachments for approximately two hours.\n* Users of Confluence, Jira Service Management, and Jira Software were unable to view or upload attachments.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an outage of Atlassian's internal Artefact Repository Manager due to a combination of an abnormally high load and misconfiguration of rate limiting and circuit breaking. As a result, the products listed above could not access Docker images and other necessary artifacts to scale up, which caused partial degradation of some services or complete unavailability of some other services for customers. The restart of the internal Artifact Repository Manager and changes in policies and configuration caused downtime to the service but led to successful recovery.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. After the immediate impact of this outage was resolved, the incident response team completed a technical analysis of the root cause and contributing factors. The team has conducted a post-incident review to determine how we can avoid the impact of this kind of outage in the future.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to minimize the likelihood of incidents of this type reoccurring:\n\n* Build redundancy into the artifact management system to increase resiliency.\n* Make changes to our internal infrastructure and affected systems to improve resiliency.\n* Improve our internal documentation for incident resolution.\n* Tweak alerting to improve the detection and TTR of similar incidents in the future.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **CONTEXT**\n\nAtlassian Cloud products, applications, the customer experiences they provide, as well as supporting services and Atlassian’s own internal tooling rely on compute and data workloads deployed in Amazon Web Services \\(AWS\\) Virtual Private Cloud \\(VPC\\).\n\nCritical to the function of these applications is the network communication between them, as well as to the Internet and AWS-managed services. This communication depends on DNS resolution, which applications perform by querying a DNS server to translate service names into network addresses they can connect to.\n\nTo facilitate DNS resolution across multiple accounts and VPCs, Atlassian operates [centralized EC2 \\(Elastic Compute Cloud\\) DNS servers](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-centralize-dns-management-in-a-multi-account-environment/) in each AWS region we serve customers from.\n\nAtlassian is currently in the process of migrating from this centralized infrastructure to a more resilient distributed solution that leverages [AWS-managed VPC resolver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#AmazonDNS) in a [Shared VPC architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9NMA3ACZDM). However, a number of internal applications and services still rely on the EC2-based solution.\n\nThe EC2-based DNS servers utilize [security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html), which are subject to [connection tracking allowance limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html)instrumented by AWS.\n\n### **INCIDENT SUMMARY**\n\nOn November 22, 2022, between 19:39 and 21:28 UTC, some Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket customers experienced varying levels of degradation across our products and services, including partner apps and integrations. The incident was detected within nine minutes by an automated monitoring system and resolved within one hour and 49 minutes.\n\nThe event was triggered by Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure within the AWS us-east-1 region encountering a network connection tracking allowance limit. Despite the fault being localized to one region, there was a global impact for customers whose data resided in us-east-1, as well as Atlassian products which have unique dependencies on that region.\n\nThe issue was initially mitigated by scaling up the DNS infrastructure, which increased the connection tracking allowance limit and returned Atlassian products to a healthy state. The underlying issue has since been resolved by a configuration change and cannot reoccur.\n\nThe incident was not caused by an attack and it was not a security issue. Atlassian customer data remains secure.\n\nWe deeply value the trust placed in Atlassian and apologize to customers who were affected by the event.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe impact occurred on November 22, 2022, between 19:39 and 21:28 UTC, for a total of one hour and 49 minutes. Some Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket customers experienced service degradation ranging from intermittent access to a complete outage. Customers experienced error pages or very slow responses in applications and browsers, as well as 5xx response codes from our APIs.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident occurred as connections through Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure reached a new daily peak due to steady traffic growth. As a result, [a limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#connection-tracking-throttling) on the number of simultaneous network connections [tracked by an AWS EC2 security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html) was encountered. Upon reaching this limit, DNS packets were dropped, meaning services were unable to resolve network addresses which resulted in application failures. Services retried their DNS queries upon receiving a SERVFAIL response or query timeout, which created even more connections - compounding the problem.\n\nDuring the incident, Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure in the AWS us-east-1 region was unable to service up to 90% of DNS resolution requests.\n\nWe were not aware of how close our infrastructure was to the security group connection tracking limit because utilization of this allowance is not currently observable.\n\nTroubleshooting took an extended period of time because EC2 network allowance packet drops \\(as a result of encountering this limit\\) [were not actively monitored](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-network-performance-ena.html) by Atlassian.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nAtlassian acknowledges that outages like this one impact the productivity and business of our customers. Since this incident:\n\n* We have deployed an immediate change to prevent traffic through Atlassian’s EC2-based DNS infrastructure from [consuming the security group connection allowance limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#untracked-connections). As a result of this change, this incident cannot reoccur.\n* We are investigating ways to improve our visibility into the utilization of AWS network allowance limits and will [monitor packet drops](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-network-performance-ena.html) due to them. \n* We are continuing our migration of internal services away from the EC2-based DNS infrastructure involved in this incident to a new, distributed architecture that is not subject to these network limits.\n\nAgain, we apologize to those customers whose services were impacted during this incident.\n\nThank you,  \nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn Oct 4th, 2022, between 7:17 AM and 8:12 AM UTC, Atlassian customers using Bitbucket Cloud were unable to access the website. The event was triggered by a configuration change that hit a bug in the envoy proxy version we are using for cluster management. [Envoy proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) is a high performance, small footprint edge and service proxy and also load balancer. The incident was detected within 14 minutes by automated monitoring and on-call engineers were immediately paged. The incident was resolved by reverting the envoy config that caused the bug to be exposed, which mitigated the customer impact, getting our website into a good state. The total time to resolution was about 55 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between 7:17 AM and 8:12 AM UTC. The incident affected the Bitbucket Cloud website preventing users from accessing the website. Bitbucket Cloud API, Git over SSH, and Git over HTTPS were not impacted by this incident.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a [bug](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/21587) in envoy proxy where it does not handle hostnames in the Redis cluster command. We deployed the envoy proxy config for a new Elasticache Redis cluster which was planned to be used by other microservices in the near future. The envoy configuration change that resulted in the envoy bug did not affect existing Bitbucket website instances, so they were not affected by the bug after the envoy configuration deployment. Instead, the bug was exposed by the envoy config that was applied to new instances that were created by the scale-up event, so our website could not scale as new instances were failing to start since they were dependent on the envoy proxy to be up and running. This caused existing instances to hit high CPU utilization, fail health checks and eventually crash since they could not keep up with the increase in traffic to the Bitbucket Cloud website.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes \\(post-deployment verification tests across all environments\\) in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the envoy proxy bug manifested itself only on newly provisioned instances of envoy proxy as part of the microservice, existing instances of the microservice were not affected by the bug.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Redeploy Bitbucket Cloud service once envoy proxy config changes are deployed and run post-deployment verification tests in our pre-production environments to prevent this incident from re-occurrence. This will also ensure our post-deployment checks can run against our new configuration just after the deployment, without waiting for our website to scale to use the new configuration.\n* Upgrade envoy proxy to the[ most recent version ](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.22.0/version_history/current)of envoy proxy that has the fix for the bug in the Redis filter.\n* Faster rollbacks for the envoy control plane service that pushes config to envoy proxy to reduce our time to recovery \\(TTR\\) in the event this occurs again.\n* Improved and faster alerting and monitoring for detecting the degradation of microservice to reduce our time to detection \\(TTD\\) in the event this occurs again.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The event was triggered when our storage vendor experienced an outage at their data center. The outage was caused by a firmware upgrade resulting in a subset of their storage clusters failing to update correctly. The incident was detected within 14 mins by our on-call SRE team and was escalated to our storage vendor who began restoring the failed nodes to bring their storage services online again. The total time to resolution was seven hours and 33 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between 01:46 PM and 09:19 PM UTC on Bitbucket Cloud. The Incident caused service disruption to some of our users, causing affected customers to be unable to access repositories via the CLI, or browse the Bitbucket Cloud website.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a firmware update to the nodes made by our storage vendor; few nodes failed to update and went down over a span of several hours. And as a result, the affected Bitbucket Cloud customers could not access their repositories and the users received HTTP 504 errors.\n\nThe root cause of the incident was the firmware update process, which did not properly update and restart all storage nodes.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages are impactful to your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific failure with the firmware upgrade process wasn't detected prior to deployment.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Implementing detection and alerting mechanism that validates each storage volume is accessible and available.\n* Working with our external vendor on preventative measures as well as improved detection on their end.\n* Implement alerting mechanism about errors that would be generated for failed firmware updates.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn June 22, 2022, from 01:08 AM UTC to 03:42 AM UTC, some customers using Bitbucket Pipelines, Confluence Cloud, Forge, and Jira Cloud family of products \\(Jira Software, Jira Service Management, Jira Work Management\\). While for Bitbucket Pipelines there was an increase in build failures, Jira, Confluence, and Forge experienced performance and functionality degradation. The event was triggered by our internal Artifact Repository Manager becoming unavailable during a scheduled multi-availability zone disaster recovery test. Customers across all regions were affected. The incident was detected within two minutes by monitoring and mitigated by restarting the Artifact Repository service, which recovered the affected products. The total time to resolution was about three hours.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between June 22, 2022, 01:08 AM UTC, and June 22, 2022, 05:58 AM UTC on Bitbucket Pipelines, Confluence Cloud, Forge, and Jira Cloud family of products \\(Jira Software, Jira Service Management, Jira Work Management\\). The outage of the internal Artifact Repository Manager caused scalability problems in the aforementioned products and an inability to build or deploy new versions of our services. That meant the degradation of performance and functionality for most of these products.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an outage of the internal Artifact Repository Manager during the planned multi-availability zone disaster recovery test. As a result, the products listed above could not access docker images and other necessary artifacts to scale up, which caused partial degradation of services or complete unavailability of services for some customers. The restart of the internal Artifact Repository Manager caused downtime to the service but led to successful recovery.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages may impact your productivity. After the immediate impact of this outage was resolved, the incident response team completed a technical analysis of the root cause and contributing factors. The team has conducted a post-incident review to determine how we can avoid the impact of this kind of outage in the future.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* We raised a critical issue with the vendor who provides us with software for Artifact Management to optimise the resilience of the application caused by availability zone failures.\n* We are working on improving our disaster recovery plan to be able to mitigate such incidents faster.\n* We are reviewing our test strategies to be able to catch similar issues in the early stages.\n\nTo minimize the impact of such incidents on our customers, we will implement additional preventative measures such as:\n\n* Development of a redundant caching mechanism for our platform system to improve the scalability and reliability of our products.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn May 03, 2022, between 13:21 and 14:12 UTC, a majority of AMER and EMEA customers using Jira Software, Jira Service Management, or Confluence Cloud as well as all customers of Bitbucket Cloud were unable to search for users and teams, mention users and teams, assign issues and tickets, and perform some JQL queries. The incident was triggered by a throughput issue after a routine upgrade of a primary database cluster in our eu-west region followed by a failure of multiple levels of redundancy. Our us-east and eu-west regions were affected.\n\nThe incident was detected within one minute by our monitoring systems and our on-call engineer responded approximately four minutes after impact began. The team was able to mitigate this issue by shedding some of the load on our us-east region by reversing the failover for team search. Our SLOs returned to normal after approximately 51 minutes. Over the following 48 hours, our engineers monitored the situation and worked to restore the redundant systems to normal operation.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between May 03, 2022, 13:21 UTC and May 03, 2022, 14:12 UTC. The incident caused service disruption to AMER and EMEA customers using Jira Software, Jira Service Management, or Confluence Cloud as well as all customers of Bitbucket Cloud. Specifically, the features below were impacted during this time:\n\nJira Software & Jira Service Management\n\n* Assigning issues and tickets to users\n* Mentioning users or teams\n* Some JQL queries involving user details\n* Searching for users\n* Searching for teams\n\nConfluence Cloud\n\n* Mentioning users or teams\n* Searching for users\n* Searching for teams\n\nBitbucket Cloud\n\n* Mentioning users or teams\n* Searching for users\n* Searching for teams\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe user search service, a central service responsible for storing and returning user search results from our cloud products, has two redundant database clusters provisioned in five globally distributed regions. Each database cluster is intended to be large enough to be able to support all search traffic in case of a database failure or database maintenance. Over the last couple of weeks, we began to see latency for search responses increase in our eu-west region, which generally indicates under-scaled clusters. \n\nThe team began the process of increasing the scale of our clusters in our eu-west region. We began work on May 02, 2022 at 19:44 UTC to scale up our primary database cluster and updated our configuration so all search traffic in our eu-west region was served from our redundant database cluster. The process started when our eu-west traffic was off-peak and gave us a 10 hour window to minimize risk.\n\nThis routine upgrade was expected to provide a 20% increase in throughput. But for an unknown reason currently under investigation by Amazon Web Services, we observed reduced throughput in that database cluster by at least 75%. This left our eu-west region without a primary database cluster and a redundant database cluster not yet scaled to handle peak traffic. The team spent the next 10 hours, with support from AWS, attempting to fix the degraded database cluster before peak traffic.\n\nUnfortunately, the team was unable to recover the performance of our primary database cluster and the redundant database cluster was unable to handle peak load in our eu-west region. The team immediately triggered a failover of all eu-west traffic to our us-east region as soon as search latencies exceeded SLOs. Our us-east region's traffic was off-peak and the us-east database clusters are significantly larger than database clusters in other regions. These larger database clusters are designed to give us the ability to safely handle region failovers. The failover occurred on May 03, 2022 at 08:37 UTC. Approximately 5 hours later, on May 03, 2022 at 13:25 UTC, the on-call engineer was paged due to multiple node failures in our us-east region.\n\nIn rare situations, the database cluster can have a node failure due to a variety of causes. The database cluster can self-heal by relocating its data onto new nodes. The user search team has built a mechanism to force all traffic to the redundant cluster in that region immediately after a node failure is detected. This mechanism allows the user search service to meet its latency and reliability SLOs in that region and reduces the load on the unhealthy database cluster to expedite its recovery.\n\nUnfortunately, this put four times the normal amount of traffic on our redundant database cluster in our us-east region. This amount of load is well outside of our current design specifications and the database cluster could not keep up with this intense load. User search requests began to timeout and the products that make requests to this core user search service were unable to return search results to our customers. The team was able to mitigate this issue by shedding some of the load on our us-east region by reversing the failover for only team search, a low-touch, but resource-intense query. This was enough to stabilize the us-east cluster enough to handle peak traffic. Our SLOs returned to normal after approximately 51 minutes. Over the following 48 hours, our engineers monitored the situation and worked to restore the redundant systems to normal operation.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWhile we have a number of redundancies in place, we have multiple things we can do to prevent cascading failures of multiple redundant systems in the future. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* A temporary scale up of all database clusters to a level above design spec in all regions hosting the user search service. This will allow the service to handle multiple region failovers gracefully.\n* Set up a periodic review of our database cluster performance with the goal of deciding if the team should temporarily or permanently scale up clusters to keep up with demand.\n* We are reprioritizing our efforts towards the rollout of an upcoming architecture change designed to significantly improve the performance and resiliency of the service.\n* The user search service team will update their runbooks on how to better respond to multi-region failures.\n* Continue working with AWS to fully understand the root cause behind the failed database cluster upgrade.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn December 7, 2021, between 15:54 UTC and December 8, 2021, at 01:55 UTC, Atlassian Cloud services using AWS services in the US-EAST-1 region experienced a failure. This affected customers using Atlassian Access, Bitbucket Cloud, Compass, Confluence Cloud, the Jira family of products, and Trello. Products were unable to operate as expected, resulting in partial or complete degradation of services. The event was triggered by an AWS networking outage in US-EAST-1 affecting multiple AWS services and led to the inability to access AWS APIs and the AWS management console. The incident was first reported by Atlassian Access whose monitoring detected faults accessing DynamoDB services in the region. Recovery of affected Atlassian services occurred on a service-by-service basis from 2021-12-07 21:50 UTC when the underlying AWS services also began to recover. Full recovery of Atlassian Cloud services was notified at 2021-12-08 1:55 UTC.\n\n  \n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact occurred between December 7, 2021, between 15:54 UTC and December 8, 2021, at 01:55 UTC_._ The incident caused partial to complete service disruption of Atlassian Cloud services in the US-EAST-1 region. Product-specific impacts are listed below.\n\nThe primary impact for customers of Jira Software, Jira Service Management and Jira Work Management hosted in the US-EAST-1 region, was being unable to scale up, which caused slow response times for web requests and delays in background job processing, including webhooks in the AP region. There was significant latency for customers accessing Jira. Some customers experienced service unavailability while the incident took place. \n\nJira Align experienced an email outage for US customers due to the AWS Service outage that affected many of the AWS Services including Simple Email Service. A small percentage of Jira Align emails were not sent due to the AWS incident.\n\nBitbucket Pipelines was unavailable and steps failed to be executed.\n\nFor Jira Automation, tenant’s rules execution were delayed since CloudWatch was affected.\n\nConfluence experienced minor impact due to upstream services impacting user management, search, notifications, and media. At the same time Confluence was impacted by error rates related to the inability to scale up, and GraphQL had higher latencies.\n\nTrello email-to-board and dashcards features experienced degraded performance.\n\nAtlassian Access reported product transfers from one organization failed intermittently. Admins were not able to update features like IP Allowlist, Audit Logs, Data Residency, Custom Domain Email Notification and Mobile Application Management. Yet, users were able to access and view these features. During the incident, emails to admins experienced a delay. There was degraded experience when creating and deleting API tokens. \n\nStatuspage was largely unaffected. However, notification workers could not scale up and communications to customers were delayed, though they could be replayed later. The incident also impacted users trying to sign in to manage portals and private pages.\n\nCompass experienced a minor impact on its ability to write to its primary database store. No core features were affected. \n\nAtlassian's customers could have experienced stale data issues in production, US-EAST-1 for ~30s, against expected 5s at p99, because of delayed token resolution. \n\nThe provisioning of new cloud tenants was also impacted until the recovery of the services. \n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a problem with several network devices within AWS’s internal network. These devices were receiving more traffic than they were able to process, which led to elevated latency and packet loss. As a result, it affected multiple AWS services which Atlassian's platform relies on, causing service degradation and disruption to the products mentioned above. For more information in regards to the root cause, see [Summary of the AWS Service Event in the Northern Virginia \\(US-EAST-1\\) Region](https://aws.amazon.com/message/12721).\n\nThere were no relevant Atlassian-driven events in the lead-up that have been identified to cause or contribute to this incident.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are taking immediate steps to improve the Atlassian platform's resiliency and availability to reduce the impact of such an event in the future. While Atlassian's Cloud services do run in several regions \\(US EAST and WEST, AP, EU CENTRAL and WEST, among others\\) and data is replicated across several regions to increase the resilience against outages of this magnitude, we have identified and are taking actions that include improvements to our region failover process. This will minimize the impact of future outages on Atlassian’s Cloud services and provide better support for our customers. \n\nWe are prioritizing the following actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Enhance and strengthen our plans for cross-region resiliency and disaster recovery plans, including: continue practicing region failover in production, investigate and implement better resilience strategies for services, Active/Active or Active/Passive.\n* Improving and adopting multi-region architecture for services that do require it. \n* Exercise wargaming scenarios that will simulate this outage to assess customer view of the incident. This will allow us to create further action items to improve our region failover process. \n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident. \n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
