The incidents were detected immediately by our internal monitoring and fully resolved within one hour for the initial incident and two hours for the second incident.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nCustomers who were impacted were unable to access the [bitbucket.org](http://bitbucket.org) website, APIs, Pipelines, and Git over HTTPS and SSH during the following times:\n\n* All Bitbucket services were impacted on June 2, 2023 between 00:07 UTC and 00:49 UTC_._ Website and API requests recovered after 7 minutes, while Git operations were not fully operational until 00:49 UTC.\n* All Bitbucket services were impacted on June 6, 2023 between 06:25 UTC and 08:19 UTC. Git operations recovered at 07:41 UTC. Website and API traffic recovered briefly from 07:16 UTC to 08:06 UTC but experienced additional instability from 08:07 UTC to 08:19 UTC.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nBoth incidents were triggered by database cluster restarts. The June 2, 2023 incident was caused by a bug in the version of our database engine. The June 6, 2023 incident was caused by a maintenance patch being applied to all nodes in our database cluster.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating these types of incidents in the future and reduce recovery time:\n\n* Enhance safeguards around patch application on the database\n* Improve how our services recover from database failures\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The incidents were detected immediately by our internal monitoring and fully resolved within one hour for the initial incident and two hours for the second incident.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nCustomers who were impacted were unable to access the [bitbucket.org](http://bitbucket.org) website, APIs, Pipelines, and Git over HTTPS and SSH during the following times:\n\n* All Bitbucket services were impacted on June 2, 2023 between 00:07 UTC and 00:49 UTC_._ Website and API requests recovered after 7 minutes, while Git operations were not fully operational until 00:49 UTC.\n* All Bitbucket services were impacted on June 6, 2023 between 06:25 UTC and 08:19 UTC. Git operations recovered at 07:41 UTC. Website and API traffic recovered briefly from 07:16 UTC to 08:06 UTC but experienced additional instability from 08:07 UTC to 08:19 UTC.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nBoth incidents were triggered by database cluster restarts. The June 2, 2023 incident was caused by a bug in the version of our database engine. The June 6, 2023 incident was caused by a maintenance patch being applied to all nodes in our database cluster.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating these types of incidents in the future and reduce recovery time:\n\n* Enhance safeguards around patch application on the database\n* Improve how our services recover from database failures\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The incident was detected within three minutes by automated monitoring and mitigated by a rollback of the change which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour and 32 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe impact across products was:\n\n* Bitbucket - Bitbucket Pipelines self-hosted builds were failing, access to Git LFS failed and cloud-hosted builds were delayed.\n* Confluence, Jira Align, Jira Service Management, Jira Software, Jira Work Management, Jira Product Discovery, and Atlas - media capabilities \\(images, videos, documents, audio\\) were affected and it was not possible to upload, download or view existing media attachments or files.\n\nThe service disruption lasted for one hour and 32 minutes between May 15, 2023, 02:36 and May 15, 2023, 04:08 UTC and caused service disruption to customers with services hosted in the us-west-1 region.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an attempted migration of a service to a new network segment. As part of this migration, a DNS record pointing to the old network segment was not updated, which resulted in failure when the old network stack was removed. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified as moving services across network segments is not a regular activity and is difficult to accurately replicate in a test environment. To mitigate against these types of issues, we made this change using blue/green deployment practices but failed to run adequate verification steps before decommissioning the old stack.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Reviewing our systems that decommission service stacks and implementing checks that customer traffic is no longer being served prior to decommissioning the stacks; and\n* As part of our service network migration process, we are adding steps to identify when there are associated DNS records that require attention.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn February 2, 2023, between 9:00 AM and 10:30 AM UTC, Atlassian customers using the Bitbucket Cloud experienced degraded performance and timeouts of the website. The event was triggered by a feature flag configuration that created an unexpected load on core infrastructure. Customers across all regions were affected. The incident was detected within 10 minutes by automatic monitoring and mitigated by disabling the feature flag and scaling up the number of website servers, which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour and 30 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between 9:00 AM and 10:30 AM UTC on February 2, 2023, on Bitbucket Cloud. The Incident caused service disruption to customers in all regions where they experienced slow website response times and website requests timing out. This affected users' ability to use Bitbucket Cloud through the web user interface, including functions such as viewing and merging pull requests, viewing commits and files in Git repositories, and viewing the dashboard.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused when a feature flag was enabled with a higher-than-anticipated evaluation cost. The feature flag was only enabled for an internal team, but the method used to evaluate that condition resulted in an increased load on each server. That increased load caused slower request times, and as we were operating at our peak listed server capacity, we ultimately ended up queuing requests which is when customers started seeing timeouts and errors instead of just slow requests. Manually scaling up the servers allowed us to spread that load out and serve requests without queuing until we found the cause and disabled the inefficient evaluation of the feature flag.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the change was related to causing an increase in website's CPU load that was not picked up by our automated continuous deployment suites and manual test scripts.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* We have changed how we evaluate feature flag configuration so that high-volume feature flag evaluation doesn't increase the load on the website service. \n* We have doubled the maximum available capacity to allow for the website auto-scaling to absorb additional load caused by any performance-impacting changes\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn December 16, 2022, between 10:07 and 15:40 UTC, Atlassian's internal artifact management infrastructure experienced an outage. Some Atlassian customers using Bitbucket Pipelines, Marketplace apps and integrations, and managing attachments across Atlassian cloud products were impacted. Bitbucket users experienced failures of Bitbucket pipelines and Bitbucket pipeline runners, Marketplace apps and integrations users experienced missing webhooks, and actions on attachments \\(especially uploads\\) were impacted across all our products. The event was triggered by Atlassian's internal Artifact Repository Manager becoming unavailable due to a combination of an abnormally high load and misconfiguration of rate limiting and circuit breaking. Customers in all regions were impacted. The incident was immediately detected by our monitoring systems and mitigated by changing policies and configuration, which allowed the Artifact Repository Manager to recover. The total time to resolution was about five hours and 33 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nWe detected the impact of this incident on December 16, 2022, at 10:07 UTC, recovery started at 11:00 UTC with most of the functionality restored by 12:12 UTC, and full recovery was achieved at 15:40 UTC.\n\nBelow is the breakdown of the impact for each product.\n\nMarketplace apps and integrations:\n\n* Webhooks were intermittently impacted for approximately two hours \\(10:07 UTC - 12:07 UTC\\).\n* Between 13:45 UTC and 15:40 UTC, we observed a significantly increased failure rate and drop in traffic on app discoverability \\(apps disappearing from products UI\\), app execution \\(apps execution failing\\), and developer capabilities \\(app deployment and management\\).\n\nBitbucket:\n\n* Bitbucket Pipelines rely heavily on our internal artifact management infrastructure to fetch the necessary container images during builds and were impacted for the duration of the incident.\n* We have detected approximately 60,000 build steps failures in the affected period.\n\nAll Atlassian cloud products:\n\n* Our internal attachment management infrastructure had encountered scaling issues and this intermittently affected the ability to upload/manage attachments for approximately two hours.\n* Users of Confluence, Jira Service Management, and Jira Software were unable to view or upload attachments.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an outage of Atlassian's internal Artefact Repository Manager due to a combination of an abnormally high load and misconfiguration of rate limiting and circuit breaking. As a result, the products listed above could not access Docker images and other necessary artifacts to scale up, which caused partial degradation of some services or complete unavailability of some other services for customers. The restart of the internal Artifact Repository Manager and changes in policies and configuration caused downtime to the service but led to successful recovery.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. After the immediate impact of this outage was resolved, the incident response team completed a technical analysis of the root cause and contributing factors. The team has conducted a post-incident review to determine how we can avoid the impact of this kind of outage in the future.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to minimize the likelihood of incidents of this type reoccurring:\n\n* Build redundancy into the artifact management system to increase resiliency.\n* Make changes to our internal infrastructure and affected systems to improve resiliency.\n* Improve our internal documentation for incident resolution.\n* Tweak alerting to improve the detection and TTR of similar incidents in the future.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **CONTEXT**\n\nAtlassian Cloud products, applications, the customer experiences they provide, as well as supporting services and Atlassian’s own internal tooling rely on compute and data workloads deployed in Amazon Web Services \\(AWS\\) Virtual Private Cloud \\(VPC\\).\n\nCritical to the function of these applications is the network communication between them, as well as to the Internet and AWS-managed services. This communication depends on DNS resolution, which applications perform by querying a DNS server to translate service names into network addresses they can connect to.\n\nTo facilitate DNS resolution across multiple accounts and VPCs, Atlassian operates [centralized EC2 \\(Elastic Compute Cloud\\) DNS servers](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-centralize-dns-management-in-a-multi-account-environment/) in each AWS region we serve customers from.\n\nAtlassian is currently in the process of migrating from this centralized infrastructure to a more resilient distributed solution that leverages [AWS-managed VPC resolver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#AmazonDNS) in a [Shared VPC architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9NMA3ACZDM). However, a number of internal applications and services still rely on the EC2-based solution.\n\nThe EC2-based DNS servers utilize [security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html), which are subject to [connection tracking allowance limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html)instrumented by AWS.\n\n### **INCIDENT SUMMARY**\n\nOn November 22, 2022, between 19:39 and 21:28 UTC, some Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket customers experienced varying levels of degradation across our products and services, including partner apps and integrations. The incident was detected within nine minutes by an automated monitoring system and resolved within one hour and 49 minutes.\n\nThe event was triggered by Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure within the AWS us-east-1 region encountering a network connection tracking allowance limit. Despite the fault being localized to one region, there was a global impact for customers whose data resided in us-east-1, as well as Atlassian products which have unique dependencies on that region.\n\nThe issue was initially mitigated by scaling up the DNS infrastructure, which increased the connection tracking allowance limit and returned Atlassian products to a healthy state. The underlying issue has since been resolved by a configuration change and cannot reoccur.\n\nThe incident was not caused by an attack and it was not a security issue. Atlassian customer data remains secure.\n\nWe deeply value the trust placed in Atlassian and apologize to customers who were affected by the event.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe impact occurred on November 22, 2022, between 19:39 and 21:28 UTC, for a total of one hour and 49 minutes. Some Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket customers experienced service degradation ranging from intermittent access to a complete outage. Customers experienced error pages or very slow responses in applications and browsers, as well as 5xx response codes from our APIs.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident occurred as connections through Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure reached a new daily peak due to steady traffic growth. As a result, [a limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#connection-tracking-throttling) on the number of simultaneous network connections [tracked by an AWS EC2 security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html) was encountered. Upon reaching this limit, DNS packets were dropped, meaning services were unable to resolve network addresses which resulted in application failures. Services retried their DNS queries upon receiving a SERVFAIL response or query timeout, which created even more connections - compounding the problem.\n\nDuring the incident, Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure in the AWS us-east-1 region was unable to service up to 90% of DNS resolution requests.\n\nWe were not aware of how close our infrastructure was to the security group connection tracking limit because utilization of this allowance is not currently observable.\n\nTroubleshooting took an extended period of time because EC2 network allowance packet drops \\(as a result of encountering this limit\\) [were not actively monitored](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-network-performance-ena.html) by Atlassian.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nAtlassian acknowledges that outages like this one impact the productivity and business of our customers. Since this incident:\n\n* We have deployed an immediate change to prevent traffic through Atlassian’s EC2-based DNS infrastructure from [consuming the security group connection allowance limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#untracked-connections). As a result of this change, this incident cannot reoccur.\n* We are investigating ways to improve our visibility into the utilization of AWS network allowance limits and will [monitor packet drops](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-network-performance-ena.html) due to them. \n* We are continuing our migration of internal services away from the EC2-based DNS infrastructure involved in this incident to a new, distributed architecture that is not subject to these network limits.\n\nAgain, we apologize to those customers whose services were impacted during this incident.\n\nThank you,  \nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **CONTEXT**\n\nAtlassian Cloud products, applications, the customer experiences they provide, as well as supporting services and Atlassian’s own internal tooling rely on compute and data workloads deployed in Amazon Web Services \\(AWS\\) Virtual Private Cloud \\(VPC\\).\n\nCritical to the function of these applications is the network communication between them, as well as to the Internet and AWS-managed services. This communication depends on DNS resolution, which applications perform by querying a DNS server to translate service names into network addresses they can connect to.\n\nTo facilitate DNS resolution across multiple accounts and VPCs, Atlassian operates [centralized EC2 \\(Elastic Compute Cloud\\) DNS servers](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-centralize-dns-management-in-a-multi-account-environment/) in each AWS region we serve customers from.\n\nAtlassian is currently in the process of migrating from this centralized infrastructure to a more resilient distributed solution that leverages [AWS-managed VPC resolver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#AmazonDNS) in a [Shared VPC architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9NMA3ACZDM). However, a number of internal applications and services still rely on the EC2-based solution.\n\nThe EC2-based DNS servers utilize [security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html), which are subject to [connection tracking allowance limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html)instrumented by AWS.\n\n### **INCIDENT SUMMARY**\n\nOn November 22, 2022, between 19:39 and 21:28 UTC, some Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket customers experienced varying levels of degradation across our products and services, including partner apps and integrations. The incident was detected within nine minutes by an automated monitoring system and resolved within one hour and 49 minutes.\n\nThe event was triggered by Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure within the AWS us-east-1 region encountering a network connection tracking allowance limit. Despite the fault being localized to one region, there was a global impact for customers whose data resided in us-east-1, as well as Atlassian products which have unique dependencies on that region.\n\nThe issue was initially mitigated by scaling up the DNS infrastructure, which increased the connection tracking allowance limit and returned Atlassian products to a healthy state. The underlying issue has since been resolved by a configuration change and cannot reoccur.\n\nThe incident was not caused by an attack and it was not a security issue. Atlassian customer data remains secure.\n\nWe deeply value the trust placed in Atlassian and apologize to customers who were affected by the event.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe impact occurred on November 22, 2022, between 19:39 and 21:28 UTC, for a total of one hour and 49 minutes. Some Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket customers experienced service degradation ranging from intermittent access to a complete outage. Customers experienced error pages or very slow responses in applications and browsers, as well as 5xx response codes from our APIs.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident occurred as connections through Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure reached a new daily peak due to steady traffic growth. As a result, [a limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#connection-tracking-throttling) on the number of simultaneous network connections [tracked by an AWS EC2 security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html) was encountered. Upon reaching this limit, DNS packets were dropped, meaning services were unable to resolve network addresses which resulted in application failures. Services retried their DNS queries upon receiving a SERVFAIL response or query timeout, which created even more connections - compounding the problem.\n\nDuring the incident, Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure in the AWS us-east-1 region was unable to service up to 90% of DNS resolution requests.\n\nWe were not aware of how close our infrastructure was to the security group connection tracking limit because utilization of this allowance is not currently observable.\n\nTroubleshooting took an extended period of time because EC2 network allowance packet drops \\(as a result of encountering this limit\\) [were not actively monitored](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-network-performance-ena.html) by Atlassian.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nAtlassian acknowledges that outages like this one impact the productivity and business of our customers. Since this incident:\n\n* We have deployed an immediate change to prevent traffic through Atlassian’s EC2-based DNS infrastructure from [consuming the security group connection allowance limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#untracked-connections). As a result of this change, this incident cannot reoccur.\n* We are investigating ways to improve our visibility into the utilization of AWS network allowance limits and will [monitor packet drops](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-network-performance-ena.html) due to them. \n* We are continuing our migration of internal services away from the EC2-based DNS infrastructure involved in this incident to a new, distributed architecture that is not subject to these network limits.\n\nAgain, we apologize to those customers whose services were impacted during this incident.\n\nThank you,  \nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn Oct 4th, 2022, between 7:17 AM and 8:12 AM UTC, Atlassian customers using Bitbucket Cloud were unable to access the website. The event was triggered by a configuration change that hit a bug in the envoy proxy version we are using for cluster management. [Envoy proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) is a high performance, small footprint edge and service proxy and also load balancer. The incident was detected within 14 minutes by automated monitoring and on-call engineers were immediately paged. The incident was resolved by reverting the envoy config that caused the bug to be exposed, which mitigated the customer impact, getting our website into a good state. The total time to resolution was about 55 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between 7:17 AM and 8:12 AM UTC. The incident affected the Bitbucket Cloud website preventing users from accessing the website. Bitbucket Cloud API, Git over SSH, and Git over HTTPS were not impacted by this incident.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a [bug](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/21587) in envoy proxy where it does not handle hostnames in the Redis cluster command. We deployed the envoy proxy config for a new Elasticache Redis cluster which was planned to be used by other microservices in the near future. The envoy configuration change that resulted in the envoy bug did not affect existing Bitbucket website instances, so they were not affected by the bug after the envoy configuration deployment. Instead, the bug was exposed by the envoy config that was applied to new instances that were created by the scale-up event, so our website could not scale as new instances were failing to start since they were dependent on the envoy proxy to be up and running. This caused existing instances to hit high CPU utilization, fail health checks and eventually crash since they could not keep up with the increase in traffic to the Bitbucket Cloud website.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes \\(post-deployment verification tests across all environments\\) in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the envoy proxy bug manifested itself only on newly provisioned instances of envoy proxy as part of the microservice, existing instances of the microservice were not affected by the bug.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Redeploy Bitbucket Cloud service once envoy proxy config changes are deployed and run post-deployment verification tests in our pre-production environments to prevent this incident from re-occurrence. This will also ensure our post-deployment checks can run against our new configuration just after the deployment, without waiting for our website to scale to use the new configuration.\n* Upgrade envoy proxy to the[ most recent version ](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.22.0/version_history/current)of envoy proxy that has the fix for the bug in the Redis filter.\n* Faster rollbacks for the envoy control plane service that pushes config to envoy proxy to reduce our time to recovery \\(TTR\\) in the event this occurs again.\n* Improved and faster alerting and monitoring for detecting the degradation of microservice to reduce our time to detection \\(TTD\\) in the event this occurs again.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn Sept 25, 2022, between 01:46 PM and 09:19 PM UTC, some Atlassian customers using Bitbucket Cloud were unable to access their repositories. The event was triggered when our storage vendor experienced an outage at their data center. The outage was caused by a firmware upgrade resulting in a subset of their storage clusters failing to update correctly. The incident was detected within 14 mins by our on-call SRE team and was escalated to our storage vendor who began restoring the failed nodes to bring their storage services online again. The total time to resolution was seven hours and 33 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between 01:46 PM and 09:19 PM UTC on Bitbucket Cloud. The Incident caused service disruption to some of our users, causing affected customers to be unable to access repositories via the CLI, or browse the Bitbucket Cloud website.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a firmware update to the nodes made by our storage vendor; few nodes failed to update and went down over a span of several hours. And as a result, the affected Bitbucket Cloud customers could not access their repositories and the users received HTTP 504 errors.\n\nThe root cause of the incident was the firmware update process, which did not properly update and restart all storage nodes.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages are impactful to your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific failure with the firmware upgrade process wasn't detected prior to deployment.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Implementing detection and alerting mechanism that validates each storage volume is accessible and available.\n* Working with our external vendor on preventative measures as well as improved detection on their end.\n* Implement alerting mechanism about errors that would be generated for failed firmware updates.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The root cause was a DNS service deployment in US East region, which caused widespread DNS lookup errors for a variety of Atlassian services including authentication services.

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn June 22, 2022, from 01:08 AM UTC to 03:42 AM UTC, some customers using Bitbucket Pipelines, Confluence Cloud, Forge, and Jira Cloud family of products \\(Jira Software, Jira Service Management, Jira Work Management\\). While for Bitbucket Pipelines there was an increase in build failures, Jira, Confluence, and Forge experienced performance and functionality degradation. The event was triggered by our internal Artifact Repository Manager becoming unavailable during a scheduled multi-availability zone disaster recovery test. Customers across all regions were affected. The incident was detected within two minutes by monitoring and mitigated by restarting the Artifact Repository service, which recovered the affected products. The total time to resolution was about three hours.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between June 22, 2022, 01:08 AM UTC, and June 22, 2022, 05:58 AM UTC on Bitbucket Pipelines, Confluence Cloud, Forge, and Jira Cloud family of products \\(Jira Software, Jira Service Management, Jira Work Management\\). The outage of the internal Artifact Repository Manager caused scalability problems in the aforementioned products and an inability to build or deploy new versions of our services. That meant the degradation of performance and functionality for most of these products.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an outage of the internal Artifact Repository Manager during the planned multi-availability zone disaster recovery test. As a result, the products listed above could not access docker images and other necessary artifacts to scale up, which caused partial degradation of services or complete unavailability of services for some customers. The restart of the internal Artifact Repository Manager caused downtime to the service but led to successful recovery.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages may impact your productivity. After the immediate impact of this outage was resolved, the incident response team completed a technical analysis of the root cause and contributing factors. The team has conducted a post-incident review to determine how we can avoid the impact of this kind of outage in the future.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* We raised a critical issue with the vendor who provides us with software for Artifact Management to optimise the resilience of the application caused by availability zone failures.\n* We are working on improving our disaster recovery plan to be able to mitigate such incidents faster.\n* We are reviewing our test strategies to be able to catch similar issues in the early stages.\n\nTo minimize the impact of such incidents on our customers, we will implement additional preventative measures such as:\n\n* Development of a redundant caching mechanism for our platform system to improve the scalability and reliability of our products.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn May 03, 2022, between 13:21 and 14:12 UTC, a majority of AMER and EMEA customers using Jira Software, Jira Service Management, or Confluence Cloud as well as all customers of Bitbucket Cloud were unable to search for users and teams, mention users and teams, assign issues and tickets, and perform some JQL queries. The incident was triggered by a throughput issue after a routine upgrade of a primary database cluster in our eu-west region followed by a failure of multiple levels of redundancy. Our us-east and eu-west regions were affected.\n\nThe incident was detected within one minute by our monitoring systems and our on-call engineer responded approximately four minutes after impact began. The team was able to mitigate this issue by shedding some of the load on our us-east region by reversing the failover for team search. Our SLOs returned to normal after approximately 51 minutes. Over the following 48 hours, our engineers monitored the situation and worked to restore the redundant systems to normal operation.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between May 03, 2022, 13:21 UTC and May 03, 2022, 14:12 UTC. The incident caused service disruption to AMER and EMEA customers using Jira Software, Jira Service Management, or Confluence Cloud as well as all customers of Bitbucket Cloud. Specifically, the features below were impacted during this time:\n\nJira Software & Jira Service Management\n\n* Assigning issues and tickets to users\n* Mentioning users or teams\n* Some JQL queries involving user details\n* Searching for users\n* Searching for teams\n\nConfluence Cloud\n\n* Mentioning users or teams\n* Searching for users\n* Searching for teams\n\nBitbucket Cloud\n\n* Mentioning users or teams\n* Searching for users\n* Searching for teams\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe user search service, a central service responsible for storing and returning user search results from our cloud products, has two redundant database clusters provisioned in five globally distributed regions. Each database cluster is intended to be large enough to be able to support all search traffic in case of a database failure or database maintenance. Over the last couple of weeks, we began to see latency for search responses increase in our eu-west region, which generally indicates under-scaled clusters. \n\nThe team began the process of increasing the scale of our clusters in our eu-west region. We began work on May 02, 2022 at 19:44 UTC to scale up our primary database cluster and updated our configuration so all search traffic in our eu-west region was served from our redundant database cluster. The process started when our eu-west traffic was off-peak and gave us a 10 hour window to minimize risk.\n\nThis routine upgrade was expected to provide a 20% increase in throughput. But for an unknown reason currently under investigation by Amazon Web Services, we observed reduced throughput in that database cluster by at least 75%. This left our eu-west region without a primary database cluster and a redundant database cluster not yet scaled to handle peak traffic. The team spent the next 10 hours, with support from AWS, attempting to fix the degraded database cluster before peak traffic.\n\nUnfortunately, the team was unable to recover the performance of our primary database cluster and the redundant database cluster was unable to handle peak load in our eu-west region. The team immediately triggered a failover of all eu-west traffic to our us-east region as soon as search latencies exceeded SLOs. Our us-east region's traffic was off-peak and the us-east database clusters are significantly larger than database clusters in other regions. These larger database clusters are designed to give us the ability to safely handle region failovers. The failover occurred on May 03, 2022 at 08:37 UTC. Approximately 5 hours later, on May 03, 2022 at 13:25 UTC, the on-call engineer was paged due to multiple node failures in our us-east region.\n\nIn rare situations, the database cluster can have a node failure due to a variety of causes. The database cluster can self-heal by relocating its data onto new nodes. The user search team has built a mechanism to force all traffic to the redundant cluster in that region immediately after a node failure is detected. This mechanism allows the user search service to meet its latency and reliability SLOs in that region and reduces the load on the unhealthy database cluster to expedite its recovery.\n\nUnfortunately, this put four times the normal amount of traffic on our redundant database cluster in our us-east region. This amount of load is well outside of our current design specifications and the database cluster could not keep up with this intense load. User search requests began to timeout and the products that make requests to this core user search service were unable to return search results to our customers. The team was able to mitigate this issue by shedding some of the load on our us-east region by reversing the failover for only team search, a low-touch, but resource-intense query. This was enough to stabilize the us-east cluster enough to handle peak traffic. Our SLOs returned to normal after approximately 51 minutes. Over the following 48 hours, our engineers monitored the situation and worked to restore the redundant systems to normal operation.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWhile we have a number of redundancies in place, we have multiple things we can do to prevent cascading failures of multiple redundant systems in the future. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* A temporary scale up of all database clusters to a level above design spec in all regions hosting the user search service. This will allow the service to handle multiple region failovers gracefully.\n* Set up a periodic review of our database cluster performance with the goal of deciding if the team should temporarily or permanently scale up clusters to keep up with demand.\n* We are reprioritizing our efforts towards the rollout of an upcoming architecture change designed to significantly improve the performance and resiliency of the service.\n* The user search service team will update their runbooks on how to better respond to multi-region failures.\n* Continue working with AWS to fully understand the root cause behind the failed database cluster upgrade.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
