This impact was caused by an issue with Bitbucket’s database, resulting in connection pools becoming saturated, increasing response times, and a ramp-up of requests timing out completely.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nCustomers who were impacted experienced increased latency when accessing the [bitbucket.org](http://bitbucket.org/) website and APIs during the duration of the incident. Git requests over HTTPS and SSH were also affected.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident was caused by a bug in the version of Amazon Aurora being used. With Bitbucket’s query patterns, if the vacuum process does not run frequently enough, discrepancies in Aurora’s visibility map can result in poor query planner performance.\n\nDue to this bug, the autovacuuming configuration on the database, which has been tuned to our specific workload previously, is no longer proving to be effective. While the appropriate tuning of autovacuuming is determined, we have implemented a process that will trigger a vacuum as soon as a discrepancy in the Aurora visibility map is detected. We are confident this will prevent a repeat incident while we determine an appropriate autovacuum threshold and cadence.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to reduce recovery time, limit impact, and avoid repeating these types of incidents in the future:\n\n* Vacuuming immediately when a visibility map discrepancy is detected.\n* Appropriately tuning autovacuum settings to meet the requirements of our workload.\n* Upgrading our Aurora version as soon as the fix becomes available.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

This was caused by the vacuum process not being run frequently enough on our high-traffic database tables, which impaired the database’s ability to handle requests. This resulted in connection pools becoming saturated, response times increasing, and a ramp-up of requests timing out completely.\n\nAfter the database recovered at 13:30 UTC, Bitbucket Pipelines experienced build scheduling delays as it processed the backlog of jobs. Additional resources were added to Bitbucket Pipelines and the backlog was cleared in full by 17:30 UTC.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nCustomers who were impacted experienced significant delays with running Bitbucket Pipelines and increased latency when accessing the [bitbucket.org](http://bitbucket.org/) website and APIs during the duration of the incident. Git requests over HTTPS and SSH were unaffected.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident was caused by an issue during the routine autovacuuming of our active database tables, which impaired its ability to serve requests. This led to slowdowns that impacted a variety of Bitbucket services, including the queuing of a large backlog of unscheduled pipelines.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to reduce recovery time, limit impact, and avoid repeating these types of incidents in the future:\n\n* Reconfigure vacuuming threshold for high write activity database tables.\n* Adjust alert thresholds to proactively catch this behavior earlier and reduce potential impact.\n* Tuning autoscaling and load shedding behavior for Pipelines services and increasing build runner capacity.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to reduce recovery time, limit impact, and avoid repeating these types of incidents in the future:\n\n* Reconfigure vacuuming threshold for high write activity database tables.\n* Adjust alert thresholds to proactively catch this behavior earlier and reduce potential impact.\n* Tuning autoscaling and load shedding behavior for Pipelines services and increasing build runner capacity.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **Summary**\n\nOn February 14, 2024, between 20:05 UTC and 23:03 UTC, Atlassian customers on the following cloud products encountered a service disruption: Access, Atlas, Atlassian Analytics, Bitbucket, Compass, Confluence, Ecosystem apps, Jira Service Management, Jira Software, Jira Work Management, Jira Product Discovery, Opsgenie, StatusPage, and Trello.\n\nAs part of a security and compliance uplift, we had scheduled the deletion of unused and legacy domain names used for internal service-to-service connections. Active domain names were incorrectly deleted during this event. This impacted all cloud customers across all regions. The issue was identified and resolved through the rollback of the faulty deployment to restore the domain names and Atlassian systems to a stable state. The time to resolution was two hours and 58 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nExternal customers started reporting issues with Atlassian cloud products at 20:52 UTC. The impact of the failed change led to performance degradation or in some cases, complete service disruption. Symptoms experienced by end-users were unsuccessful page loads and/or failed interactions with our cloud products.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nAs part of a security and compliance uplift, we had scheduled the deletion of unused and legacy domain names that were being used for internal service-to-service connections. Active domain names were incorrectly deleted during this operation.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. The detection was delayed because existing testing & monitoring focused on service health rather than the entire system’s availability.\n\nTo prevent a recurrence of this type of incident, we are implementing the following improvement measures:\n\n* Canary checks to monitor the entire system availability.\n* Faster rollback procedures for this type of service impact.\n* Stricter change control procedures for infrastructure modifications.\n* Migration of all DNS records to centralised management and stricter access controls on modification to DNS records.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\n‌\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The impact of this incident has been mitigated and our monitoring tools confirm that the success-rate is back to the pre-incident behaviour. It impacted 16 apps according to our logs, where these apps saw a reduced success rate of storage.get API calls, as listed in https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/runtime-reference/storage-api-basic.\n\nAs part of Forge's preparation to support Data Residency, Forge hosted storage has been undergoing a platform and data migration for storing app data. As part of this migration we do comparison checks for data consistency between the old and new platform. The previous incident earlier, https://developer.status.atlassian.com/incidents/9q71ytpjhbtl, had put the data on the new platform out of sync and so comparisons of the data from the old and new platform started showing failures and the migration logic retries on failures to test for consistency issues. This retry behaviour increased latency of these requests which led to 16 apps receiving an increased number of 504 timeout errors. \n\nChecking synchronously was identified by the team as a bug and should have been async. Once the root cause was identified we moved our backing platform rollout to a previous stage. The rollout is split into several stages. The issues we were having were on our blocking stage where we make calls to both the old and new platform and wait for both to complete so we can test any performance issues in the new platform before using it as our source of truth. It was in this blocking stage where we had a bug that included waiting on comparisons when it should've been async.\n\nTo recover, we reverted back to our shadow mode stage. In this stage, all operations to the new platform are asynchronous, including comparisons that were blocking in the other stage and resulted in timeout issues and 504 errors being sent to apps. This is the state that Forge hosted storage has been in for several months without any problems.\n\nHere is the timeline of the impact:\n- On 2024-02-05 at 06:42 PM UTC, impact started with comparisons start happening on out of sync data in blocking mode\n- On 2024-02-05 at 08:57 PM UTC, impact was detected to API by our monitoring systems\n- On 2024-02-05 at 11:34 PM UTC, rollout to new platform was reverted to known stable state and impact ended\n\nWe will release a public incident review, PIR, here in the upcoming weeks for this and the incident that happened earlier, https://developer.status.atlassian.com/incidents/9q71ytpjhbtl. We will detail all that we can about what caused the issue, and what we are doing to prevent it from happening again.\n\nWe apologise for any inconveniences this may have caused our customers and the developer community and committed to preventing further issues with our hosted storage capability.",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn Dec 18, 2023, between 12:29 p.m. and 3:35 p.m. UTC, Dec 18, 2023, Atlassian's cloud customers using Atlas, Bitbucket Cloud, Compass, Confluence Cloud, Jira Service Management, Jira Software, Jira Work Management, Jira Product Discovery products were unable to search for users or use the \"@mention\" functionality. Customers' user search results failed or were delayed as Atlassian's service returning user search results was degraded in several regions.\n\nThe incident originated from a computationally intensive operation that was triggered multiple times in rapid succession, resulting in degraded performance of Atlassian's user search service across several regions. Notably, customers in the EU west region were most affected. The incident was detected within 2 minutes by automated monitoring, and our team promptly took action by recovering unhealthy systems and scaling up the service's infrastructure temporarily. The resolution process concluded in 3 hours and 06 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between Dec 18, 2023, between 12:29 p.m. UTC and Dec 18, 2023, 3:35 p.m. UTC. The Incident caused service disruption to cloud customers worldwide. Customers experienced delayed or failed user searches when using the following Atlassian cloud products:\n\n* Atlas\n* Bitbucket Cloud\n* Compass\n* Confluence Cloud\n* Jira Service Management\n* Jira Software\n* Jira Work Management\n* Jira Product Discovery\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident stemmed from Atlassian's user search service receiving commands to process multiple computationally intensive operations in rapid succession. These operations were directed at the same customer data set, and therefore overloaded resources within a clustered database system, leading to memory exhaustion and subsequent unresponsiveness to user search requests. \n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nTo prevent a recurrence of such incidents, we are implementing the following measures:\n\n* Implement a mechanism to queue computationally intensive operations in order to avoid overloading the resources within the systems and process them without impact on customer experience.\n* Fine-tune our clustered database settings to mitigate the impact of resource exhaustion on the overall system. \n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were affected during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the service’s resiliency.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

This event was triggered when our storage vendor experienced an outage at their data center. The incident was detected immediately by our internal monitoring, escalated to the vendor, and fully resolved after 24 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nCustomers who were impacted were unable to access the [bitbucket.org](http://bitbucket.org/) website, APIs, Pipelines, and Git over HTTPS and SSH during the duration of the incident.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident was caused by an outage at our storage vendor’s data center. This affected our ability to communicate with our storage volumes, backing up our internal services and preventing them from continuing to serve requests.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to reduce recovery time, limit impact, and avoid repeating these types of incidents in the future:\n\n* Working with our storage vendor on preventative measures as well as improved detection on their end.\n* Improve resilience to reduce widespread customer impact when a subset of infrastructure is impacted.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn Sep 13, 2023, between 12:00 PM UTC and 03: 30 PM UTC, some Atlassian users were unable to sign in to their accounts and use multiple Atlassian cloud products. The event was triggered by a misconfiguration of rate limits in an internal service which caused a cascading failure in sign-in and signup-related APIs. The incident was quickly detected by multiple automated monitoring systems. The incident was mitigated on Sep 13, 2023, 03: 30 PM UTC by the rollback of a feature and additional scaling of services which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 3 hours & 30 minutes.\n\n‌\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between Sep 13, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC and Sep 13, 2023, 03: 30 PM UTC on multiple products. The Incident caused intermittent service disruption across all regions. Some users were unable to sign in for sessions. Other scenarios that temporarily failed were new user signups, profile retrieval, and password reset. During the incident we had a peak of 90% requests failing across authentication, user profile retrieval, and password reset use cases.\n\n‌\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused due to a misconfiguration of a rate limit in an internal core service. As a result, some sign-in requests over the limit received HTTP 429 errors. However, retry behavior for requests caused a multiplication of load which led to higher service degradation. As many internal services depend on each other, the call graph complexity led to a longer time to detect the actual faulty service.\n\n‌\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are continuously improving our system's resiliency.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Audit and improve service rate limits and client retry and backoff behavior.\n* Improve scale and load test automation for complex service interactions.\n* Audit cross-service dependencies and minimize them where possible related to sign-in flows.\n\n‌\n\nDue to the unavailability of sign-in, some customers were unable to create support tickets. We are making additional process improvements to:\n\n* Enable our unauthenticated support contact form and notify users that it should be used when standard channels are not available.\n* Create status page notifications more quickly and ensure that for severe incidents, notifications to all subscribers are enabled.\n\n‌\n\nWe apologize to users who were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s reliability and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn 2023-08-02, Atlassian customers were unable to perform a range of billing and cloud provisioning actions. It affected the Jira family of products, Confluence, Marketplace apps, and Bitbucket. The event started when in the normal order of operation, traffic to Atlassian billing systems increased and new nodes were supposed to be created. However, due to a prior rotation of passwords, new nodes were unable to connect to the Atlassian billing systems database. This meant that no new nodes were spun up to handle the increased traffic and the existing nodes became overloaded.\n\nThe incident was mitigated by resetting the passwords and new nodes were able to be created.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on 2023-08-02, on [www.atlassian.com](http://www.atlassian.com), [my.atlassian.com](http://my.atlassian.com), Billing Admin UI, Marketplace, and Bitbucket. The incident caused customers to be unable to use the aforementioned Atlassian billing systems in all regions. The outage lasted for 3 hours and 10 minutes and impacted the following products and services:\n\n[www.atlassian.com](http://www.atlassian.com)\n\n* Could not signup for new cloud accounts\n* Could not activate new products on existing cloud accounts\n* Could not create, view or pay for quotes \n\n[my.atlassian.com](http://my.atlassian.com)\n\n* Offline\n\nIn-app billing admin UI for cloud accounts\n\n* Could not view/update billing details\n* Could not provide bill estimate\n* Could not activate new products or apps\n\nMarketplace\n\n* Could not activate or deactivate apps on existing cloud accounts\n* Vendors could not update their configuration or the configuration of their apps\n* Some delay in updating vendor sales reports during the time of the incident\n\nBitbucket\n\n* Could not update billing details\n* Could not provide bill estimate\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nFor reasons related to keeping our systems secure, passwords used for some of the Atlassian billing systems are rotated. However, the same passwords were used in other parts of the Atlassian billing infrastructure. This had the unintended side effect that it became impossible to create new nodes to handle increased traffic. Nodes that already were up and running kept functioning, but weren't able to handle the increased load.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that any outage impacts your productivity. We make every effort to keep all our systems up and running in a reliable and secure manner. Unfortunately, in this case, rotating passwords for security reasons had the unintended side effect of making our billing systems unavailable. \n\nAs a high-priority action, we have separated the passwords being used in different services across the billing systems. Furthermore, we are undertaking a comprehensive program to modernize the security infrastructure for our billing systems, significantly reducing the need to use passwords.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn JUL 13, 2023, between 13:48 and 16:05 UTC, Atlassian customers using Bitbucket Cloud were experiencing degraded performance for git operations. The event was triggered by a bug that was deployed to production. The changes included the introduction of a bug that bypassed a critical cache for git operations which impacted all Bitbucket Cloud customers. The incident was detected within 10 minutes by automated monitoring and mitigated by rolling back the code changes and the redeployment of some services which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 2 hours & 17 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between JUL 13, 2023, 13:48 UTC and JUL 13, 2023, 16:05 UTC on Bitbucket Cloud products. The Incident caused service disruption to all customers where they experienced slow response times or failures when interacting with repository data. As a result of network saturation causing connections to queue, customers experienced increased latency and error rates across Bitbucket Cloud services.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a change to a feature flag that contained a bug which bypassed a critical cache. As a result, more requests were directly accessing the disks which led to increased latency and eventually, degraded the performance of some operations.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the impact was subtle and took approximately 48 hours to surface after initial deployment. This slow ramping was not picked up by our automated continuous test scripts because it requires significant load to reach the tipping point where systems start to become degraded.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Alerting on cache hit/miss rates\n* Improving the monitoring of network saturation for connections to our disks\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\n‌\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The event was triggered by a change in the rate limiting for that endpoint, causing them to be applied globally. The incident was detected within 5 minutes by automated monitoring and mitigated by reverting the change responsible which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 2 hours & 38 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nEverywhere in Bitbucket Cloud that retrieved a list of repository branches was affected which includes the pull request creation pages and API as well as pipelines builds. The total time that customers experienced this impact was approximately 2.5 hours.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a change to the repository branches list endpoint. As a result, users making calls to retrieve their list of branches received HTTP 429 errors. More specifically a change to the branches list endpoint caused the endpoint to incorrectly apply the repository level rate limit globally. The root cause of the incident was the failure in the detection of the bug by the deployment validations.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the change was related to a very specific kind of legacy case that was not picked up by our automated continuous deployment suites and manual test scripts.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Prevent rate limiting from being able to be applied globally\n* Remove these rate limits from generic rules\n\nTo minimize the impact of breaking changes to our environments, we will implement additional preventative measures such as:\n\n* Standardized way of disabling rate limiting to decrease time to resolution\n* Improved testing\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

On July 6, 2023, from 03:52 to 15:11 UTC, we experienced an issue with an upgraded version of a third-party tool that functions as our internal artifact management system. Despite our monitoring system identifying the incident within two minutes, this issue led to the degradation of the scaling capabilities of our internal hosting platform, resulting in service degradation or outages for customers of Atlassian cloud.\n\nIn response to this situation, we are taking immediate measures to enhance the stability of our system and prevent similar issues from re-occurring.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThis incident affected multiple regions and products due to the diminished scaling capabilities of our internal hosting platform. In most products and offerings, customers faced reduced functionality, slower response times, and limited access to specific features.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe root cause of the incident was the introduction of new functionality in a third-party tool that functions as our internal artifact management system. It led to an unexpected increase in the load on the primary database of the artifact system.\n\nUpon identifying and localizing the problem, we promptly adjusted the system configuration to regain stability.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nOver the next months, we will enact a temporary freeze on non-critical upgrades of the artifact management system, and we will focus our efforts on three high-priority initiatives:\n\n1. **Enhancing system scaling:** We prioritized work ensuring that downtime in a critical infrastructure component does not affect the scaling of other components. We expect to complete this initiative within the next two months.\n2. **Reducing interdependencies:** We are working to mitigate the risk of potential cascading failures by ensuring that significant system components are able to operate independently in the case of issues. Initiatives 1 and 2 are already in progress but have been given priority to be completed as soon as possible.\n3. **Strengthening testing procedures:** Alongside these initiatives, we are addressing the need for even more stringent testing procedures than we already have in place to prevent potential issues in future updates. We are committed to collaborating closely with our technology partners to ensure the most optimal experience for our customers.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience caused by this incident and appreciate your understanding. Our team is dedicated to continually improving our systems and processes to provide you with the exceptional service you deserve. Thank you for your continued support and trust in us.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The incidents were detected immediately by our internal monitoring and fully resolved within one hour for the initial incident and two hours for the second incident.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nCustomers who were impacted were unable to access the [bitbucket.org](http://bitbucket.org) website, APIs, Pipelines, and Git over HTTPS and SSH during the following times:\n\n* All Bitbucket services were impacted on June 2, 2023 between 00:07 UTC and 00:49 UTC_._ Website and API requests recovered after 7 minutes, while Git operations were not fully operational until 00:49 UTC.\n* All Bitbucket services were impacted on June 6, 2023 between 06:25 UTC and 08:19 UTC. Git operations recovered at 07:41 UTC. Website and API traffic recovered briefly from 07:16 UTC to 08:06 UTC but experienced additional instability from 08:07 UTC to 08:19 UTC.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nBoth incidents were triggered by database cluster restarts. The June 2, 2023 incident was caused by a bug in the version of our database engine. The June 6, 2023 incident was caused by a maintenance patch being applied to all nodes in our database cluster.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating these types of incidents in the future and reduce recovery time:\n\n* Enhance safeguards around patch application on the database\n* Improve how our services recover from database failures\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The incidents were detected immediately by our internal monitoring and fully resolved within one hour for the initial incident and two hours for the second incident.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nCustomers who were impacted were unable to access the [bitbucket.org](http://bitbucket.org) website, APIs, Pipelines, and Git over HTTPS and SSH during the following times:\n\n* All Bitbucket services were impacted on June 2, 2023 between 00:07 UTC and 00:49 UTC_._ Website and API requests recovered after 7 minutes, while Git operations were not fully operational until 00:49 UTC.\n* All Bitbucket services were impacted on June 6, 2023 between 06:25 UTC and 08:19 UTC. Git operations recovered at 07:41 UTC. Website and API traffic recovered briefly from 07:16 UTC to 08:06 UTC but experienced additional instability from 08:07 UTC to 08:19 UTC.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nBoth incidents were triggered by database cluster restarts. The June 2, 2023 incident was caused by a bug in the version of our database engine. The June 6, 2023 incident was caused by a maintenance patch being applied to all nodes in our database cluster.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating these types of incidents in the future and reduce recovery time:\n\n* Enhance safeguards around patch application on the database\n* Improve how our services recover from database failures\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The incident was detected within three minutes by automated monitoring and mitigated by a rollback of the change which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour and 32 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe impact across products was:\n\n* Bitbucket - Bitbucket Pipelines self-hosted builds were failing, access to Git LFS failed and cloud-hosted builds were delayed.\n* Confluence, Jira Align, Jira Service Management, Jira Software, Jira Work Management, Jira Product Discovery, and Atlas - media capabilities \\(images, videos, documents, audio\\) were affected and it was not possible to upload, download or view existing media attachments or files.\n\nThe service disruption lasted for one hour and 32 minutes between May 15, 2023, 02:36 and May 15, 2023, 04:08 UTC and caused service disruption to customers with services hosted in the us-west-1 region.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an attempted migration of a service to a new network segment. As part of this migration, a DNS record pointing to the old network segment was not updated, which resulted in failure when the old network stack was removed. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified as moving services across network segments is not a regular activity and is difficult to accurately replicate in a test environment. To mitigate against these types of issues, we made this change using blue/green deployment practices but failed to run adequate verification steps before decommissioning the old stack.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Reviewing our systems that decommission service stacks and implementing checks that customer traffic is no longer being served prior to decommissioning the stacks; and\n* As part of our service network migration process, we are adding steps to identify when there are associated DNS records that require attention.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
