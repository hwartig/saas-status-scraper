          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nFrom 9pm UTC on October 23, 2023, until 3am UTC on October 25, 2023, Atlassian customers using the Jira family products that have configured notifications from custom email domains experienced a degradation as email notifications were being sent from the default [atlassian.net](http://atlassian.net) domain instead of a custom domain. The incident was detected by Atlassian customers as they started to receive notifications from the [atlassian.net](http://atlassian.net) domain instead of previously configured custom domains. It was mitigated by excluding redundant validations from the custom domain verification job which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 30 hours.\n\nNote: the initially published timeframe of the incident was incorrect and was adjusted together with time to resolution.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between October 23, 2023 9pm UTC and October 25 3am UTC on Jira family products, including Jira Service Management, Jira Software and Jira Work Management. The incident caused service disruption to customers who have notifications from custom email domains enabled for their Jira products as email notifications were being sent from the default [atlassian.net](http://atlassian.net) domain instead of the custom domain configured by the customer.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a change to the service responsible for custom domain email notifications lifecycle that inadvertently enabled SPF record validation as part of a daily validation job. As a result, previously working custom domain configuration transitioned to an unverified state for some Atlassian customers, resulting in notifications from Jira products being sent from [atlassian.net](http://atlassian.net) domain instead of a previously configured custom domain.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are continuously improving our system's resiliency. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Improve monitoring and alerting for custom domains lifecycle to detect such regressions before they reach production.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The incident was detected within one minute by our monitoring systems. Recovery of affected Atlassian services occurred on a product-by-product basis with full recovery for all products completed by September 19 2023 04:15 AM UTC.\n\n‌\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nProduct impact varied based on which regions and availability zones services are using, with services hosted in us-west-2 being affected more than services hosted in us-east-1.  \n\nProduct-specific impacts are listed below:\n\n* **Jira Software -** A number of Jira nodes were affected with highly elevated error rates due to Jira databases in us-east-1 and us-west-2 being impacted.  The impact was varied with some Jira nodes being unusable whilst others were in a usable but degraded state.\n* **Jira Service Management -** Some users hosted in us-east-1 and us-west-2 experienced problems when creating issues through the Help Center, viewing issues, transitioning issues, posting comments and using queues\n* **Jira Work Management -** Users based in us-west-2 experienced minor service degradation.\n* **Jira Product Discovery -** Users experienced some issues when loading insights.\n* **Confluence Cloud -** Impact was limited to customers hosted in the us-west-2 region. During this time, users attempting to load confluence pages experienced sporadic product degradation, including brief periods where Confluence was inaccessible, complete and partial page load failures, page timeouts, increased request latency.\n* **Trello -** Users had minimal service degradation - only 0.1% of Trello users had automation rules impacted.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe root cause was an issue with subsystem responsible for network mapping propagation within the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud in the us-east-1 \\(use1-az1\\) and us-west-2 \\(usw2-az1 and usw2-az2\\) regions, which impacted network connectivity for multiple AWS services which Atlassian products rely upon.\n\nThere was a delay between the AWS incident and Atlassian being affected as existing compute instances and resources were not affected by the issue. However any changes to networking state - such as scaling-up with additional compute nodes - experienced delays in the propagation of network mappings. This led to network connectivity issues until these network mappings had been fully propagated. Other AWS services that create or modify networking resources also saw impact as a result of this issue.\n\nThere were no relevant Atlassian-driven events in the lead-up that have been identified to cause or contribute to this incident.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nTo avoid repeating this type of incident, we are prioritizing documenting and evaluating ways to improve Availability Zone failure resiliency.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The event was triggered by a misconfiguration of rate limits in an internal service which caused a cascading failure in sign-in and signup-related APIs. The incident was quickly detected by multiple automated monitoring systems. The incident was mitigated on Sep 13, 2023, 03: 30 PM UTC by the rollback of a feature and additional scaling of services which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 3 hours & 30 minutes.\n\n‌\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between Sep 13, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC and Sep 13, 2023, 03: 30 PM UTC on multiple products. The Incident caused intermittent service disruption across all regions. Some users were unable to sign in for sessions. Other scenarios that temporarily failed were new user signups, profile retrieval, and password reset. During the incident we had a peak of 90% requests failing across authentication, user profile retrieval, and password reset use cases.\n\n‌\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused due to a misconfiguration of a rate limit in an internal core service. As a result, some sign-in requests over the limit received HTTP 429 errors. However, retry behavior for requests caused a multiplication of load which led to higher service degradation. As many internal services depend on each other, the call graph complexity led to a longer time to detect the actual faulty service.\n\n‌\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are continuously improving our system's resiliency.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Audit and improve service rate limits and client retry and backoff behavior.\n* Improve scale and load test automation for complex service interactions.\n* Audit cross-service dependencies and minimize them where possible related to sign-in flows.\n\n‌\n\nDue to the unavailability of sign-in, some customers were unable to create support tickets. We are making additional process improvements to:\n\n* Enable our unauthenticated support contact form and notify users that it should be used when standard channels are not available.\n* Create status page notifications more quickly and ensure that for severe incidents, notifications to all subscribers are enabled.\n\n‌\n\nWe apologize to users who were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s reliability and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Users with existing sessions were not impacted.\n\nBetween 5:32 and 6:00 UTC, traffic was incrementally restored to a previous build, mitigating the impact for users.\n\nThe total time to resolution was one hour and 53 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nUsers were not able to login using Atlassian's shared account management system \\([id.atlassian.com](http://id.atlassian.com)\\).\n\nThis affected users who were trying to login to the following products: Jira, Confluence, Trello, Opsgenie, mobile apps and ecosystem apps.\n\nAside from the inability to login, there was no impact on other Atlassian products or features.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nMultiple Set-Cookie headers were unintentionally modified so that only the last Set-Cookie header remained in the response to user's browsers.  The issue was caused by a change to Network Extensions within the Edge Network. As a result, users that needed a new session could not login.  Upon login, the users were redirected to login again and no session was created for them.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue was not detected in Atlassian's staging environment.  End-to-end tests did not cover the use case of multiple Set-Cookie headers in the single response and therefore this bug went unnoticed.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Automated tests to be put in place to validate that cookies are not being removed from responses.\n* Configuration of networking extensions will be guaranteed to be identical in staging and production to ensure errors are picked up earlier.\n\nFurthermore, we typically deploy our changes progressively by cloud region to avoid broad impact, but in this case, the change was not deemed risky and was deployed to all regions. To minimize the impact of breaking changes to our environments, we will implement additional preventative measures:\n\n* Changes to network extensions in the future will use progressive rollouts.\n* With staging being properly utilized, errors similar to this one will not be deployed to any production environments.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

On July 6, 2023, from 03:52 to 15:11 UTC, we experienced an issue with an upgraded version of a third-party tool that functions as our internal artifact management system. Despite our monitoring system identifying the incident within two minutes, this issue led to the degradation of the scaling capabilities of our internal hosting platform, resulting in service degradation or outages for customers of Atlassian cloud.\n\nIn response to this situation, we are taking immediate measures to enhance the stability of our system and prevent similar issues from re-occurring.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThis incident affected multiple regions and products due to the diminished scaling capabilities of our internal hosting platform. In most products and offerings, customers faced reduced functionality, slower response times, and limited access to specific features.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe root cause of the incident was the introduction of new functionality in a third-party tool that functions as our internal artifact management system. It led to an unexpected increase in the load on the primary database of the artifact system.\n\nUpon identifying and localizing the problem, we promptly adjusted the system configuration to regain stability.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nOver the next months, we will enact a temporary freeze on non-critical upgrades of the artifact management system, and we will focus our efforts on three high-priority initiatives:\n\n1. **Enhancing system scaling:** We prioritized work ensuring that downtime in a critical infrastructure component does not affect the scaling of other components. We expect to complete this initiative within the next two months.\n2. **Reducing interdependencies:** We are working to mitigate the risk of potential cascading failures by ensuring that significant system components are able to operate independently in the case of issues. Initiatives 1 and 2 are already in progress but have been given priority to be completed as soon as possible.\n3. **Strengthening testing procedures:** Alongside these initiatives, we are addressing the need for even more stringent testing procedures than we already have in place to prevent potential issues in future updates. We are committed to collaborating closely with our technology partners to ensure the most optimal experience for our customers.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience caused by this incident and appreciate your understanding. Our team is dedicated to continually improving our systems and processes to provide you with the exceptional service you deserve. Thank you for your continued support and trust in us.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Some other AWS services also experienced increased error rates and latencies as a result of degraded Lambda functions invocations.  This incident was automatically detected by multiple monitoring systems within 6 minutes, paging on-call teams. Recovery of the affected AWS Lambda service began after 116 minutes at June 13th 8:45 PM UTC.  Full recovery of all AWS services occurred at 10:37 PM UTC June 13th after the backlog of asynchronous Lambda events had been processed. Some Jira tenants with large event backlogs experienced delays in running schedule-based rule reruns. Full recovery of all Atlassian Cloud services was notified at June 14, 2023, 02:20 AM UTC.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between June 13, 2023, 06:49 PM UTC and June 14, 2023, 02:20 AM UTC.  Product-specific impacts are listed below.\n\n* Jira Software, Jira Service Management,  Jira Work Management - Automation rules were not executed for 2 hours between Jun 13, 06:49 PM UTC and Jun 13, 08:45 PM UTC.  Jira automation events generated during this period were unable to be rerun.  When AWS Lambda recovered delays were still experienced in our schedule-based and event-based rules for some larger tenants due to a large backlog of events. Full recovery was at June 14, 2023, 02:20 AM UTC.\n* Confluence - Automation rules were not executed for 2 hours between Jun 13, 06:49 PM UTC and Jun 13, 08:45 PM UTC.  On AWS service restoration Confluence automation recovered and Confluence automation events generated during this period were rerun and processed.  Full recovery was at June 14, 2023, 12:41 AM UTC.\n* Jira Product Discovery - Automation rules were not executed for 2 hours between Jun 13, 06:49 PM UTC and Jun 13, 08:45 PM UTC. Jira automation events generated during this period were unable to be rerun.  Sending feedback/filing a support ticket from the application did not work. \n* Trello -  Email to board delays, card covers image upload failures, attachment preview generation failures, board background upload failures, custom sticker images upload failures, custom emoji upload failures. Trello automation was unaffected. Full recovery was at June 13, 2023, 10:08 PM UTC.\n\nThe service disruption lasted for 7 hours and 1 minutes between June 13, 2023, 06:49 PM UTC and June 14, 2023, 02:20 AM UTC and caused service disruption to customers with services hosted in the US-EAST-1 region.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nAtlassian uses Amazon Web Services \\(AWS\\) as a cloud service provider. The root cause was an issue with a subsystem responsible for capacity management for AWS Lambda in US-EAST-1 Region, which also impacted 104 AWS services.  This impacted Automation rules as the service is hosted exclusively in this region.\n\nThere were no relevant Atlassian-driven events in the lead-up that have been identified to cause or contribute to this incident.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Increase reliability of message delivery and recoverability from Jira to Automation platform to improve recovery times. \n* Create a plan for multi-region impact mitigation for Automation.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Automation events for Confluence during that time have been reprocessed, however, events for Jira were not received and can't be recovered. After the AWS services came back online, Automation started processing any events triggered after 8:45PM UTC. Due to the volume, this caused some events to become backlogged, however, these have now been processed successfully. All new executions after the recovery are confirmed operating normally.
