          "body": "We identified a problem with the Forge hosted storage API calls, which resulted in a drop in invocation success rates in the developer console. The impact of this incident has been mitigated and our monitoring tools confirm that the success-rate is back to the pre-incident behaviour. It impacted 16 apps according to our logs, where these apps saw a reduced success rate of storage.get API calls, as listed in https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/runtime-reference/storage-api-basic.\n\nAs part of Forge's preparation to support Data Residency, Forge hosted storage has been undergoing a platform and data migration for storing app data. As part of this migration we do comparison checks for data consistency between the old and new platform. The previous incident earlier, https://developer.status.atlassian.com/incidents/9q71ytpjhbtl, had put the data on the new platform out of sync and so comparisons of the data from the old and new platform started showing failures and the migration logic retries on failures to test for consistency issues. This retry behaviour increased latency of these requests which led to 16 apps receiving an increased number of 504 timeout errors. \n\nChecking synchronously was identified by the team as a bug and should have been async. Once the root cause was identified we moved our backing platform rollout to a previous stage. The rollout is split into several stages. The issues we were having were on our blocking stage where we make calls to both the old and new platform and wait for both to complete so we can test any performance issues in the new platform before using it as our source of truth. It was in this blocking stage where we had a bug that included waiting on comparisons when it should've been async.\n\nTo recover, we reverted back to our shadow mode stage. In this stage, all operations to the new platform are asynchronous, including comparisons that were blocking in the other stage and resulted in timeout issues and 504 errors being sent to apps. This is the state that Forge hosted storage has been in for several months without any problems.\n\nHere is the timeline of the impact:\n- On 2024-02-05 at 06:42 PM UTC, impact started with comparisons start happening on out of sync data in blocking mode\n- On 2024-02-05 at 08:57 PM UTC, impact was detected to API by our monitoring systems\n- On 2024-02-05 at 11:34 PM UTC, rollout to new platform was reverted to known stable state and impact ended\n\nWe will release a public incident review, PIR, here in the upcoming weeks for this and the incident that happened earlier, https://developer.status.atlassian.com/incidents/9q71ytpjhbtl. We will detail all that we can about what caused the issue, and what we are doing to prevent it from happening again.\n\nWe apologise for any inconveniences this may have caused our customers and the developer community and committed to preventing further issues with our hosted storage capability.",

          "body": "# Summary\n\nOn January 18, 2024, starting at 06:34 UTC, customers using Atlassian Marketplace and the Jira family of products may have experienced intermittent failures.\n\nA scheduled database upgrade on an internal Atlassian Marketplace service resulted in degraded performance for that service. This degraded performance manifested in increasing response times and eventually time outs. This service degradation then cascaded upstream and resulted in requests timing out across the Jira family of products, impacting product experiences.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Jira family:\n\nOn January 18, 2024, at 07:14 UTC, the impact on product experiences hit critical alerting thresholds. \n\nThis impact would resulted in performance degradation, service unavailability or in some instances, full service disruption. Customers would have experienced this as failed page loads or failed interactions with the products. \n\nAll end user impact related to product functionality was fully resolved by 10:30 UTC.\n\n## Marketplace:\n\nOn January 18, 2024, starting from 06:34 UTC, there were impacts to customer functionality related to app management \\(install, trial, uninstall, update, purchase\\). There were also impacts to Marketplace partner functionality such as app management and account management.\n\nWe resolved the underlying service degradation and restored full service by 15:13 UTC. We then monitored closely for further impact until we officially closed the incident at 16:15 UTC.\n\n# Root Cause\n\nThe issue was caused by a scheduled database upgrade within the central service that supports the Atlassian Marketplace. The upgrade occurred during a scheduled maintenance window between 06:30 UTC and 08:30 UTC on January 18, 2024.\n\nOne of the database upgrade steps triggered degraded performance of the Marketplace service. As the performance degraded this created back pressure on clients of this service. This back pressure eventually drove request timeouts. Our global edge compounded this issue by retrying on timeout, which further exacerbated the issue and increased the load on the service.\n\nOverall this resulted in degrading performance and an effective outage on this service. Attempts to rollback the change were not immediately effective under heavy load.\n\nAtlassian products are dependent on this Marketplace service for some user-facing capabilities. In the case of this incident, there is a licensing check for some marketplace apps from Jira family into the back-end service.\n\nJira should degrade gracefully when there is degradation or outages in downstream services. For this dependency we don't have sufficient isolation of downstream impact from user experience impact on the front end which caused the impact to experiences in the Jira family. We were able to recover Jira ahead of the marketplace service recovery by breaking that hard dependency without losing end user capability.\n\n# Remedial actions & next steps\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because of a difference in load between our staging and production environments.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n## For Marketplace:\n\n* Improve concurrency handling within the service, tune and test the system for scale and performance, and apply protective measures like rate limiting.\n* Harden the database migration procedure to avoid unexpected downtime, including monitoring for expected vs unexpected alerts during upgrades.\n* Implement faster rollback / roll forward procedures for this type of service impact. \n\n## For Jira:\n\n* Isolate impact from this dependency into the product by routing through a single logical proxy responsible for ensuring appropriate circuit-breaking behaviour and timeouts.\n* Discover and identify and remediate any other potential similar class of issue. \n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Customers' user search results failed or were delayed as Atlassian's service returning user search results was degraded in several regions.\n\nThe incident originated from a computationally intensive operation that was triggered multiple times in rapid succession, resulting in degraded performance of Atlassian's user search service across several regions. Notably, customers in the EU west region were most affected. The incident was detected within 2 minutes by automated monitoring, and our team promptly took action by recovering unhealthy systems and scaling up the service's infrastructure temporarily. The resolution process concluded in 3 hours and 06 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between Dec 18, 2023, between 12:29 p.m. UTC and Dec 18, 2023, 3:35 p.m. UTC. The Incident caused service disruption to cloud customers worldwide. Customers experienced delayed or failed user searches when using the following Atlassian cloud products:\n\n* Atlas\n* Bitbucket Cloud\n* Compass\n* Confluence Cloud\n* Jira Service Management\n* Jira Software\n* Jira Work Management\n* Jira Product Discovery\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident stemmed from Atlassian's user search service receiving commands to process multiple computationally intensive operations in rapid succession. These operations were directed at the same customer data set, and therefore overloaded resources within a clustered database system, leading to memory exhaustion and subsequent unresponsiveness to user search requests. \n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nTo prevent a recurrence of such incidents, we are implementing the following measures:\n\n* Implement a mechanism to queue computationally intensive operations in order to avoid overloading the resources within the systems and process them without impact on customer experience.\n* Fine-tune our clustered database settings to mitigate the impact of resource exhaustion on the overall system. \n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were affected during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the service’s resiliency.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

It was mitigated by excluding redundant validations from the custom domain verification job which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 30 hours.\n\nNote: the initially published timeframe of the incident was incorrect and was adjusted together with time to resolution.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between October 23, 2023 9pm UTC and October 25 3am UTC on Jira family products, including Jira Service Management, Jira Software and Jira Work Management. The incident caused service disruption to customers who have notifications from custom email domains enabled for their Jira products as email notifications were being sent from the default [atlassian.net](http://atlassian.net) domain instead of the custom domain configured by the customer.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a change to the service responsible for custom domain email notifications lifecycle that inadvertently enabled SPF record validation as part of a daily validation job. As a result, previously working custom domain configuration transitioned to an unverified state for some Atlassian customers, resulting in notifications from Jira products being sent from [atlassian.net](http://atlassian.net) domain instead of a previously configured custom domain.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are continuously improving our system's resiliency. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Improve monitoring and alerting for custom domains lifecycle to detect such regressions before they reach production.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The incident was detected within one minute by our monitoring systems. Recovery of affected Atlassian services occurred on a product-by-product basis with full recovery for all products completed by September 19 2023 04:15 AM UTC.\n\n‌\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nProduct impact varied based on which regions and availability zones services are using, with services hosted in us-west-2 being affected more than services hosted in us-east-1.  \n\nProduct-specific impacts are listed below:\n\n* **Jira Software -** A number of Jira nodes were affected with highly elevated error rates due to Jira databases in us-east-1 and us-west-2 being impacted.  The impact was varied with some Jira nodes being unusable whilst others were in a usable but degraded state.\n* **Jira Service Management -** Some users hosted in us-east-1 and us-west-2 experienced problems when creating issues through the Help Center, viewing issues, transitioning issues, posting comments and using queues\n* **Jira Work Management -** Users based in us-west-2 experienced minor service degradation.\n* **Jira Product Discovery -** Users experienced some issues when loading insights.\n* **Confluence Cloud -** Impact was limited to customers hosted in the us-west-2 region. During this time, users attempting to load confluence pages experienced sporadic product degradation, including brief periods where Confluence was inaccessible, complete and partial page load failures, page timeouts, increased request latency.\n* **Trello -** Users had minimal service degradation - only 0.1% of Trello users had automation rules impacted.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe root cause was an issue with subsystem responsible for network mapping propagation within the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud in the us-east-1 \\(use1-az1\\) and us-west-2 \\(usw2-az1 and usw2-az2\\) regions, which impacted network connectivity for multiple AWS services which Atlassian products rely upon.\n\nThere was a delay between the AWS incident and Atlassian being affected as existing compute instances and resources were not affected by the issue. However any changes to networking state - such as scaling-up with additional compute nodes - experienced delays in the propagation of network mappings. This led to network connectivity issues until these network mappings had been fully propagated. Other AWS services that create or modify networking resources also saw impact as a result of this issue.\n\nThere were no relevant Atlassian-driven events in the lead-up that have been identified to cause or contribute to this incident.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nTo avoid repeating this type of incident, we are prioritizing documenting and evaluating ways to improve Availability Zone failure resiliency.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The event was triggered by a misconfiguration of rate limits in an internal service which caused a cascading failure in sign-in and signup-related APIs. The incident was quickly detected by multiple automated monitoring systems. The incident was mitigated on Sep 13, 2023, 03: 30 PM UTC by the rollback of a feature and additional scaling of services which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 3 hours & 30 minutes.\n\n‌\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between Sep 13, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC and Sep 13, 2023, 03: 30 PM UTC on multiple products. The Incident caused intermittent service disruption across all regions. Some users were unable to sign in for sessions. Other scenarios that temporarily failed were new user signups, profile retrieval, and password reset. During the incident we had a peak of 90% requests failing across authentication, user profile retrieval, and password reset use cases.\n\n‌\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused due to a misconfiguration of a rate limit in an internal core service. As a result, some sign-in requests over the limit received HTTP 429 errors. However, retry behavior for requests caused a multiplication of load which led to higher service degradation. As many internal services depend on each other, the call graph complexity led to a longer time to detect the actual faulty service.\n\n‌\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are continuously improving our system's resiliency.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Audit and improve service rate limits and client retry and backoff behavior.\n* Improve scale and load test automation for complex service interactions.\n* Audit cross-service dependencies and minimize them where possible related to sign-in flows.\n\n‌\n\nDue to the unavailability of sign-in, some customers were unable to create support tickets. We are making additional process improvements to:\n\n* Enable our unauthenticated support contact form and notify users that it should be used when standard channels are not available.\n* Create status page notifications more quickly and ensure that for severe incidents, notifications to all subscribers are enabled.\n\n‌\n\nWe apologize to users who were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s reliability and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Users with existing sessions were not impacted.\n\nBetween 5:32 and 6:00 UTC, traffic was incrementally restored to a previous build, mitigating the impact for users.\n\nThe total time to resolution was one hour and 53 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nUsers were not able to login using Atlassian's shared account management system \\([id.atlassian.com](http://id.atlassian.com)\\).\n\nThis affected users who were trying to login to the following products: Jira, Confluence, Trello, Opsgenie, mobile apps and ecosystem apps.\n\nAside from the inability to login, there was no impact on other Atlassian products or features.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nMultiple Set-Cookie headers were unintentionally modified so that only the last Set-Cookie header remained in the response to user's browsers.  The issue was caused by a change to Network Extensions within the Edge Network. As a result, users that needed a new session could not login.  Upon login, the users were redirected to login again and no session was created for them.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue was not detected in Atlassian's staging environment.  End-to-end tests did not cover the use case of multiple Set-Cookie headers in the single response and therefore this bug went unnoticed.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Automated tests to be put in place to validate that cookies are not being removed from responses.\n* Configuration of networking extensions will be guaranteed to be identical in staging and production to ensure errors are picked up earlier.\n\nFurthermore, we typically deploy our changes progressively by cloud region to avoid broad impact, but in this case, the change was not deemed risky and was deployed to all regions. To minimize the impact of breaking changes to our environments, we will implement additional preventative measures:\n\n* Changes to network extensions in the future will use progressive rollouts.\n* With staging being properly utilized, errors similar to this one will not be deployed to any production environments.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
