The incident was promptly identified through our monitoring systems, and our teams initiated response protocols to address the issue. The disruption resulted in increased error rates across Jira and Confluence products, temporarily affecting the experience for some of our users.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nOn August 29, 2024, between 8:32 AM and 11:35 AM UTC, there was an impact on Confluence and Jira cloud affecting customers in multiple regions. The total time to resolution was three hours and three minutes.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an outage on our external security token provider. Services which requested security tokens experienced timeouts leading to outages for our cloud products.\n\nOur automated monitoring system detected the incident within one minute and we confirmed the external service outage with the external provider. The provider resolved the outage at 10:02 AM UTC, and full system recovery for Atlassian was completed by 11:35 AM UTC.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are committed to reducing the risk of similar incidents in the future. To achieve this, we will enhance our system's ability to handle external service disruptions and improve our incident response strategies. Specifically, we will reduce our reliance on single points of failure by setting up fallback region support for the critical security service provider. Additionally, we will implement measures to minimize the recovery time of the Atlassian services once the external security provider has recovered.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Other affected features that faced intermittent failures are inviting teammates to Jira/Confluence, Jira Service Management helpseeker sign-up using email domain, and creating requests in the Jira portal.\n\n‌\n\nThe event was triggered by a faulty database configuration change, which caused approximately 25% of new login attempts to fail. The Automated Monitoring system detected the incident within five minutes and mitigated it by reverting the database configuration, which put Atlassian systems into a known-good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour and 51 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on August 22 2024, between 17:04 and 18:55 UTC on Jira, Jira Service Management, and Confluence products. The Incident caused service disruption to customers across all regions where the new logins experienced intermittent failures.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a faulty database auto-scaling configuration change. As a result, 25% of the new Atlassian login attempts received HTTP 5xx errors.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the change was related to the system's traffic load. The change reduced the database's autoscaling capacity, which was sufficient for low load conditions, but as traffic increased, the capacity was not enough. The automated testing didn’t load the system enough to detect the issue.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Streamline the login flow such that inviting teammates or helpseeker sign-ups etc are not part of the main workflow;\n* Improve the deployment pipelines such that changes to resources like database can be deployed and tested independent of the code for faster delivery.\n\nFurthermore, we deploy our changes progressively to avoid broad impact. This works well for changes in code, but in this case, the change was to a global resource like database configuration where it gets deployed universally. To minimize the impact of changes to our environments, we will implement additional preventative measures such as:\n\n* Update the testing guidelines so that any database/infrastructure change needs to complete more thorough performance and reliability testing;\n* Fix the dashboards for the traffic monitoring such that they show traffic for correct tables and indices.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### Summary\n\nOn August 19, 2024, between 6:00 am and 9:58 am UTC, Jira customers located in the EU West 1 region experienced intermittent failures when loading boards and backlogs inside team-managed projects. These failures were triggered by a bug introduced to a backend service that increased load which then triggered downstream services to reject some requests due to rate-limiting. \n\nThe incident was detected within five minutes by automated monitoring systems and mitigated by a rollback of the faulty service which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was approximately four hours.\n\n### Impact\n\nAll customers in the EU West 1 region experienced elevated error rates when trying to access the Jira team-managed boards and backlogs on Monday, August 19, between 6:00 am UTC and 10:00 am UTC. Customers may have noticed the board and backlog views failing to load due to 429 and 500 error responses. However, they may have been able to eventually view the page after multiple retries.\n\n### Root Cause\n\nThe issue was caused by a change to a service backing the team-managed experiences. Specifically, a caching layer was accidentally removed which caused a large increase in the number of requests being sent to a downstream service.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the change was related to the introduction of a feature flag that was not picked up by our automated continuous deployment suites and manual test scripts. \n\nNew feature changes are usually behind feature flags and rolled out progressively to customers to allow for increased safety when making new changes. However, in this case, the bug that caused this incident came as a result of an unintended change in behaviour when introducing this flag into our code base.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Improving the test coverage in our services to enforce caching within the service.\n* Improving the scaling configurations of our services to allow them to handle large increases in load and make them more resilient to spikes in traffic.\n* Increasing the coverage of rate limiting within our services.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### Summary\n\nFrom `12/Aug/24 10:39 UTC` to `13/Aug/24 14:38 UTC` some customers experienced degraded performance on Issue View in Jira. This was caused by a data processing compatibility problem between a cache, the underlying database, and the new deployment.\n\nDue to a slow increase in failure rate and a small initial surface area of impact, the problem didn’t immediately trigger our continuous error monitoring and alerting.\n\nOnce we identified the issue it was resolving itself through self-healing mechanisms in the infrastructure. However, in a few outlier cases, we had to intervene with tenant specific cache recalculations. All but 6 tenants were fully remediated by `12/Aug/24 21:30 UTC`.\n\nThe issue occurred on the read layer of our architecture so while customer experience was degraded, there was no data loss.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nAbout 1% of instances in were impacted over the lifetime of the incident. Users on those impacted instances would have experienced degradation when loading Issue View in a specific scenario. This was when a Multi Select Custom Field is enabled on an Issue and where that Custom Field also had a Default Value set.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nWe introduced a change in our code which caused processing of Custom Fields in specific configurations to fail. This prevented Issue View from loading issues for projects with the above specific configuration applied.\n\nThis problem occurred because of different representations of the data in the database, in the code base, and in the cache in the production environment. These multiple representations caused an exception when translating the data from one representation to the next.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nThe problem largely self healed as the cache expired and was refreshed with compatible data; however, we chose to force cache re-computation for affected tenants in order to expedite this process.   \n  \nWe chose not to roll back the deployment at that point as that would have created the reverse compatibility issue with the already healed tenants.\n\nInstead, we focussed on forward fixing with a hotfix and accelerating remediation for still affected tenants. For a small very number of tenants, forced re-computation did not immediately rectify and we had to roll forward a code hotfix to remediate.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* The already deployed hot fix to stop this particular problem recurring.\n* A series of tests for this class of issue in our read layer.\n* A review of monitoring to detect these fine grained problems before they cause more customer impact.\n\nWe apologize for any disruption this issue may have caused and are taking steps to help ensure it does not occur again.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

This caused the Jira application not to correctly balance load against database nodes within the database cluster, leading to CPU saturation of the database. We have deployed a fix to mitigate the issue and have verified that the services have recovered. The conditions that cause the bug have been addressed and we're actively working on a permanent fix.

The event was triggered by a change to the infrastructure API Gateway, which is responsible for routing the traffic to the correct application backends.\n\nThe incident was detected by the automated monitoring system within five minutes and mitigated by correcting a faulty release feature flag, which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The first communications were published on the Statuspage at 11:11pm UTC. The total time to resolution was about 75 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between 09:43pm and 10:17pm UTC, with the system initially in a degraded state, followed by a total outage between 10:17pm and 10:58pm UTC. \n\n_The Incident caused service disruption to customers in all regions and affected the following products:_\n\n* Jira Software\n* Jira Service Management\n* Jira Work Management\n* Jira Product Discovery\n* Jira Align\n* Confluence\n* Trello\n* Bitbucket\n* Opsgenie\n* Compass\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nA policy used in the infrastructure API gateway was being updated in production via a feature flag. The combination of an erroneous value entered in a feature flag, and a bug in the code resulted in the API Gateway not processing any traffic.\n\nThis created a total outage, where all users started receiving 5XX errors for most Atlassian products.\n\nOnce the problem was identified and the feature flag updated to the correct values, all services started seeing recovery immediately.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have several testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the change did not go through our regular release process and instead was incorrectly applied through a feature flag.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Prevent high-risk feature flags from being used in production\n* Improve the policy changes testing\n* Enforcing longer soak time for policy changes\n* Any feature flags should go through progressive rollouts to minimize broad impact\n* Review the infrastructure feature flags to ensure they all have appropriate defaults\n* Improve our processes and internal tooling to provide faster communications to our customers\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were affected by this incident and are taking immediate steps to address the above gaps.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
