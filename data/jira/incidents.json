This was primarily due to connectivity issues with an external service provider, which impacted our ability to perform certain operations integral to our services. The incident was promptly identified through our monitoring systems, and our teams initiated response protocols to address the issue. The disruption resulted in increased error rates across Jira and Confluence products, temporarily affecting the experience for some of our users.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nOn August 29, 2024, between 8:32â€¯AM and 11:35â€¯AM UTC, there was an impact on Confluence and Jira cloud affecting customers in multiple regions. The total time to resolution was three hours and three minutes.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an outage on our external security token provider. Services which requested security tokens experienced timeouts leading to outages for our cloud products.\n\nOur automated monitoring system detected the incident within one minute and we confirmed the external service outage with the external provider. The provider resolved the outage at 10:02 AM UTC, and full system recovery for Atlassian was completed by 11:35 AM UTC.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are committed to reducing the risk of similar incidents in the future. To achieve this, we will enhance our system's ability to handle external service disruptions and improve our incident response strategies. Specifically, we will reduce our reliance on single points of failure by setting up fallback region support for the critical security service provider. Additionally, we will implement measures to minimize the recovery time of the Atlassian services once the external security provider has recovered.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Other affected features that faced intermittent failures are inviting teammates to Jira/Confluence, Jira Service Management helpseeker sign-up using email domain, and creating requests in the Jira portal.\n\nâ€Œ\n\nThe event was triggered by a faulty database configuration change, which caused approximately 25% of new login attempts to fail. The Automated Monitoring system detected the incident within five minutes and mitigated it by reverting the database configuration, which put Atlassian systems into a known-good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour and 51 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on August 22 2024, between 17:04 and 18:55 UTC on Jira, Jira Service Management, and Confluence products. The Incident caused service disruption to customers across all regions where the new logins experienced intermittent failures.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a faulty database auto-scaling configuration change. As a result, 25% of the new Atlassian login attempts received HTTP 5xx errors.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasnâ€™t identified because the change was related to the system's traffic load. The change reduced the database's autoscaling capacity, which was sufficient for low load conditions, but as traffic increased, the capacity was not enough. The automated testing didnâ€™t load the system enough to detect the issue.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Streamline the login flow such that inviting teammates or helpseeker sign-ups etc are not part of the main workflow;\n* Improve the deployment pipelines such that changes to resources like database can be deployed and tested independent of the code for faster delivery.\n\nFurthermore, we deploy our changes progressively to avoid broad impact. This works well for changes in code, but in this case, the change was to a global resource like database configuration where it gets deployed universally. To minimize the impact of changes to our environments, we will implement additional preventative measures such as:\n\n* Update the testing guidelines so that any database/infrastructure change needs to complete more thorough performance and reliability testing;\n* Fix the dashboards for the traffic monitoring such that they show traffic for correct tables and indices.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platformâ€™s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
