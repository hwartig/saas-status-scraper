          "body": "### **CONTEXT**\n\nAtlassian Cloud products, applications, the customer experiences they provide, as well as supporting services and Atlassian’s own internal tooling rely on compute and data workloads deployed in Amazon Web Services \\(AWS\\) Virtual Private Cloud \\(VPC\\).\n\nCritical to the function of these applications is the network communication between them, as well as to the Internet and AWS-managed services. This communication depends on DNS resolution, which applications perform by querying a DNS server to translate service names into network addresses they can connect to.\n\nTo facilitate DNS resolution across multiple accounts and VPCs, Atlassian operates [centralized EC2 \\(Elastic Compute Cloud\\) DNS servers](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-centralize-dns-management-in-a-multi-account-environment/) in each AWS region we serve customers from.\n\nAtlassian is currently in the process of migrating from this centralized infrastructure to a more resilient distributed solution that leverages [AWS-managed VPC resolver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#AmazonDNS) in a [Shared VPC architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9NMA3ACZDM). However, a number of internal applications and services still rely on the EC2-based solution.\n\nThe EC2-based DNS servers utilize [security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html), which are subject to [connection tracking allowance limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html)instrumented by AWS.\n\n### **INCIDENT SUMMARY**\n\nOn November 22, 2022, between 19:39 and 21:28 UTC, some Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket customers experienced varying levels of degradation across our products and services, including partner apps and integrations. The incident was detected within nine minutes by an automated monitoring system and resolved within one hour and 49 minutes.\n\nThe event was triggered by Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure within the AWS us-east-1 region encountering a network connection tracking allowance limit. Despite the fault being localized to one region, there was a global impact for customers whose data resided in us-east-1, as well as Atlassian products which have unique dependencies on that region.\n\nThe issue was initially mitigated by scaling up the DNS infrastructure, which increased the connection tracking allowance limit and returned Atlassian products to a healthy state. The underlying issue has since been resolved by a configuration change and cannot reoccur.\n\nThe incident was not caused by an attack and it was not a security issue. Atlassian customer data remains secure.\n\nWe deeply value the trust placed in Atlassian and apologize to customers who were affected by the event.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe impact occurred on November 22, 2022, between 19:39 and 21:28 UTC, for a total of one hour and 49 minutes. Some Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket customers experienced service degradation ranging from intermittent access to a complete outage. Customers experienced error pages or very slow responses in applications and browsers, as well as 5xx response codes from our APIs.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident occurred as connections through Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure reached a new daily peak due to steady traffic growth. As a result, [a limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#connection-tracking-throttling) on the number of simultaneous network connections [tracked by an AWS EC2 security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html) was encountered. Upon reaching this limit, DNS packets were dropped, meaning services were unable to resolve network addresses which resulted in application failures. Services retried their DNS queries upon receiving a SERVFAIL response or query timeout, which created even more connections - compounding the problem.\n\nDuring the incident, Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure in the AWS us-east-1 region was unable to service up to 90% of DNS resolution requests.\n\nWe were not aware of how close our infrastructure was to the security group connection tracking limit because utilization of this allowance is not currently observable.\n\nTroubleshooting took an extended period of time because EC2 network allowance packet drops \\(as a result of encountering this limit\\) [were not actively monitored](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-network-performance-ena.html) by Atlassian.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nAtlassian acknowledges that outages like this one impact the productivity and business of our customers. Since this incident:\n\n* We have deployed an immediate change to prevent traffic through Atlassian’s EC2-based DNS infrastructure from [consuming the security group connection allowance limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#untracked-connections). As a result of this change, this incident cannot reoccur.\n* We are investigating ways to improve our visibility into the utilization of AWS network allowance limits and will [monitor packet drops](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-network-performance-ena.html) due to them. \n* We are continuing our migration of internal services away from the EC2-based DNS infrastructure involved in this incident to a new, distributed architecture that is not subject to these network limits.\n\nAgain, we apologize to those customers whose services were impacted during this incident.\n\nThank you,  \nAtlassian Customer Support",

The error was limited to users who had required fields for creating subtasks. This incident was caused by a change pushed to production that started deploying on September 5, 2022, at 10:15 PM UTC. The incident was detected within one hour and 20 minutes  and the problem was mitigated for 90 percent of affected customers in the next 6 hours, by 5:48 AM UTC on September 6.  The first mitigation to unblock the majority of customers was to revert back to the old issue create experience. The problem was completely resolved for the remaining ten percent in seven hours, by deploying the actual fix. The total time to resolution for all customers was ten hours and 45 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was from 10:20 PM UTC on September 5, 2022, to 9:05 AM UTC on September 6, 2022, and affected customers of Jira Service Management, Jira Software, Jira Work Management products. The incident caused service disruption to users when they were creating subtasks with required fields in Jira.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe root cause was a recent change in create issue code which was part of an ongoing improvement task. This change was missed by our automated continuous deployment suites and manual tests in our testing environment and got deployed to the production environment. This change affected the creation of subtasks with required fields in Jira. We acknowledge that the incident could not be mitigated earlier because we missed following our own process, to Feature Flag every single change we make, for part of the change.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, our automated continuous deployment suites and test scripts didn’t cover this use case.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Implementing additional automation testing for all the changes affecting issue creation flow.\n* Adding an additional check in our review process of going through rigorous QA checkpoints for all the trigger points and then pushing it to production.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were affected during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The incident was automatically detected at 05.14 by one of Atlassian’s automated monitoring systems. The main disruption was resolved within 16 minutes with the full recovery taking additional 74 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nBetween July 19, 2022, 05:40 UTC and July 19, 2022, 07:10 UTC Jira, Confluence and OpsGenie users saw some web pages fail to load. During the 16 minute period from 06:40 UTC to 6:56 UTC, customers were unable to access Jira Confluence and OpsGenie web UI because the Atlassian Proxy \\(the ingress point for service requests\\) was unable to service most requests.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an AWS initiated change that impacted Elastic Block Store \\(EBS\\) volume performance to such an extent that new instance creation and therefore auto scaling, was blocked.  As a result, the products above, as well as essential internal Atlassian services could not auto scale to the increasing incoming service requests as the EU region came online. Once the AWS change had been rolled back, most Atlassian services recovered. Some internal services required manual scaling as a result of unhealthy nodes preventing scaling initiation, which prolonged complete recovery.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity and we apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident. We see two main avenues to increase our resiliency during an incident where AWS auto scaling is blocked:\n\n* Implement step scaling: Simple scaling in most cases works well. In this case due to nodes becoming unhealthy, simple scaling stops responding to scaling alarms and therefore the service can become “stuck” and will not recover once scaling is possible again. We are exploring the use of step scaling, as this will allow scaling even in the case of instances becoming unhealthy.\n* Implement improved alarming to identify “stuck” scaling to increase the TTR when scaling is available again.\n\nWe are taking these immediate steps to improve the platform’s resiliency.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn July 19, 2022, between 05:40 and 07:10 UTC, Atlassian customers in the EU region using Jira, Confluence and Opsgenie experienced problems loading pages through the web UI. The incident was automatically detected at 05.14 by one of Atlassian’s automated monitoring systems. The main disruption was resolved within 16 minutes with the full recovery taking additional 74 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nBetween July 19, 2022, 05:40 UTC and July 19, 2022, 07:10 UTC Jira, Confluence and OpsGenie users saw some web pages fail to load. During the 16 minute period from 06:40 UTC to 6:56 UTC, customers were unable to access Jira Confluence and OpsGenie web UI because the Atlassian Proxy \\(the ingress point for service requests\\) was unable to service most requests.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an AWS initiated change that impacted Elastic Block Store \\(EBS\\) volume performance to such an extent that new instance creation and therefore auto scaling, was blocked.  As a result, the products above, as well as essential internal Atlassian services could not auto scale to the increasing incoming service requests as the EU region came online. Once the AWS change had been rolled back, most Atlassian services recovered. Some internal services required manual scaling as a result of unhealthy nodes preventing scaling initiation, which prolonged complete recovery.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity and we apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident. We see two main avenues to increase our resiliency during an incident where AWS auto scaling is blocked:\n\n* Implement step scaling: Simple scaling in most cases works well. In this case due to nodes becoming unhealthy, simple scaling stops responding to scaling alarms and therefore the service can become “stuck” and will not recover once scaling is possible again. We are exploring the use of step scaling, as this will allow scaling even in the case of instances becoming unhealthy.\n* Implement improved alarming to identify “stuck” scaling to increase the TTR when scaling is available again.\n\nWe are taking these immediate steps to improve the platform’s resiliency.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn 23 June, 2022, between 07:00 UTC and 07:45 UTC, some of our customers using Jira Service Management, Jira Software & Jira Work Management were seeing duplicate issues and comments being created by the Incoming Email Handlers feature in Jira. Incoming email handlers are configured in Jira to create issues or comments in any Jira project from emails via a cron job. Handlers are mapped with POP, IMAP and default mail servers. This incident only affected handlers mapped to IMAP mailboxes.\n\nThe incident was triggered by the introduction of a new state in emails' read status \\(“seen”\\). The Incoming Email Handlers started to process all emails that were not “deleted” or “read”, including emails marked in a “seen” state. This created duplicate issues and comments. \n\nThe incident was detected by customers and our on-call engineers responded approximately 4 hours after impact began. The team was able to identify the root cause and verified that there was no risk of ongoing impact. Over the following 7 days, our engineers monitored the situation and worked to help affected customers identify and action their duplicate issues and comments.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nIncoming mail handlers which were configured with IMAP mail servers reprocessed emails for the last 7 days that had been marked as \"seen\" but not \"deleted\".\n\nThe overall impact was between 23 June, 2022, 07:00 UTC and 30 June, 2022, 04:17 UTC. The incident did not cause service disruption in any region, for any customers. There was an impact to the expected behaviour of Incoming Email Handlers. Specifically, the features below were impacted during this time:\n\nAffected Products:\n\n* Jira Service Management\n* Jira Software\n* Jira Work Management\n\nImpacted Features:\n\n* Global email handlers were impacted.\n* Incoming emails were processed twice as issues.\n* Incoming emails were processed twice as comments.\n\nProject level email handlers were NOT impacted in Jira Service Management.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nWhile rolling back a feature that impacted the processing of attachments in incoming emails, the email-handling cron processed the mails from customers’ inboxes that had been marked as “seen” over the last 7 days, followed by marking them as “deleted”.\n\nGlobal Jira Incoming Mail Handlers configured for IMAP marked the mails as “deleted” after they had been processed. The Jira team was working on a functionality change to start marking mail processed by the Global Jira Incoming Mail Handlers as “seen” instead of “deleted”. This would allow the customers to configure IMAP connections for mail processors other than Jira as well. Due to a bug in one of the open-source libraries used by Jira to process emails, we started to notice that attachments from these emails stopped getting processed.\n\nTo mitigate the issue, it was decided to rollback the change in functionality until the attachments issue was resolved. Unfortunately, the rollback triggered the email-handling cron to reprocess the mails from customers' inboxes that had been marked as “seen” over the last 7 days, followed by marking them as “deleted”. Since this processing is not idempotent \\(such that a mail with a unique identifier is processed only once\\), we ended up creating duplicate issues and comments for all such mails processed over the last 7 days from the feature rollback. We could not immediately delete all these duplicated issues because we are not allowed to modify customer data without explicit consent and customers could have configured automation, webhooks or workflows for issue-deletion that could potentially create an unreliable or inconsistent state for the customers.\n\nWe decided to proactively create support tickets for all customers over the next few days to communicate the situation, presenting mitigation options such as:\n\n* sharing a JQL to query all the potentially duplicate issues across all the affected projects in JSW, JSM or JWM\n* a script to label the duplicated issues with \"Duplicated-issues-#-Atlassian\" that were created in their instance\n* steps for deleting issues in bulk\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe apologise to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s reliability.\n\nWhile we have a number of tests in place, we have identified multiple things we can do to prevent duplication of issues/comments creation via incoming emails. We are prioritising the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Improvement to the Quality Assurance process while rolling back changes on production instances.\n* Improve monitoring of alerts for the duplication of issues and comments for automatic detection of anomalies in the Email handling process.\n* Make mail processing by incoming mails Idempotent. It should not process a mail with the same identifier \\( messageId \\) again. In this case, even if some other issues triggers the reprocessing of the email, duplication of issue or comments will be avoided.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
