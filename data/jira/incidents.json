The incident was triggered by the deployment of a monitoring library upgrade, which slowed the execution of all rules. This reduced the throughput of rule processing which resulted in rules being backed up and delayed. The change manifested in poor rule performance only during periods of high traffic. This incident occurred over two time windows. For the first incident window, backed-up rule executions began to reduce 4 hours 15 minutes after the first alert, and all rules had caught up 7 hours after the first alert. For the second incident window, backed-up rule executions began to reduce 1 hour, 50 minutes after the first alert, and all rules had caught up 10 hours after the first alert.\n\nThe root cause of both incidents was identified and a change to address it was deployed by 10am UTC on March 19, 2025.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe customer’s rules were delayed on average by 1.5 hours and up to 12 hours during both incident windows. A very small number of rules encountered the following error: “_The rule actor doesn't have permission to view the event that triggered this rule_.” This error occurred because of rate limiting implemented by an internal Atlassian service due to increased throughput resulting from our mitigation efforts. These rules failed to complete successfully. All other rules eventually ran successfully.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a change introduced to an Atlassian monitoring library, which significantly degraded the Automation rule engine's performance. The performance degradation prevented Automation's system from keeping pace with processing throughput, causing a back-up of executions and subsequent customer rule delays.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue didn’t manifest itself until our systems were at peak load.\n\nThe change to the Atlassian monitoring library that was the root cause of the incident has been fixed.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions that are designed to avoid a repeat of this type of incident:\n\n* Deploying the fixed monitoring library after thorough testing\n* Implementing additional monitoring and alerting to the area of our system affected with performance degradation\n* Introducing additional pre-deployment testing designed to identify performance degradations before they impact customers\n* Increasing rate limits of certain downstream Atlassian systems to reduce the likelihood of the rule failures that occurred in this incident\n* Increasing the processing capacity of parts of our system to reduce the impact of backed up rule executions\n\nWe apologize to customers whose automation rules were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps designed to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

This disruption was due to our Content Delivery Network \\(CDN\\) not having sufficient capacity in Brazil under a certain network configuration.\n\nChanges in the lead-up to the incident included enabling CDN for Jira and Confluence in Brazil between January 20th and February 6th to improve performance and security.\n\nJira and Confluence experience success rate monitoring detected the incident within 50 minutes. The incident was mitigated by temporarily disabling CDN in Brazil, which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was two hours and 25 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on February 10, 2025, between 16:10 and 18:35 UTC to Jira and Confluence Cloud_._ The incident caused service disruption to Brazilian customers when they attempted to access or use any feature of those products. Customers observed a generic error page or “HTTP 500” error presented by our CDN provider for up to a third of all requests at peak.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nOur CDN is configured to present Jira and Confluence Cloud from static IP ranges dedicated to Atlassian.\n\nThis configuration limited the number of edge locations servicing customer requests, causing a high concentration of connections in the Brazilian region on one edge location in particular.\n\nWhen daily traffic volumes in Brazil peaked on February 10, connections through the edge location to our servers encountered a capacity limit and were rejected with a HTTP 500 error.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTION PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe understand that outages impact your productivity. We apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. Along with our CDN provider, we have already taken the following actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Our CDN provider has completed the rollout of the static, dedicated IP feature to all their edge locations and enabled Jira and Confluence Cloud to be served from all of them, thus moving to the intended configuration that will provide full network capacity.\n* We are working with our CDN provider to perform more rigorous checks of capacity and configuration for Jira and Confluence Cloud.\n* Our CDN provider increased the server connection limit for Jira and Confluence Cloud in all locations, further increasing capacity.\n* Based on the observed failure patterns, we have created additional monitoring and alerting configurations, so we will be alerted immediately if the issue reoccurs.\n\nAdditionally, we are prioritizing actions to improve the detection of failures that affect a specific region.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
