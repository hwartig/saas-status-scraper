The issue was caused by a code error in a product update utilising a fast rollout process.\n\nThe incident was detected within 8 minutes of the update rollout via automated monitoring and was mitigated by reverting the code change, which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was 2 hours and 8 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between 2025-10-27 15:06 UTC and 2025-10-27 17:14 UTC on work item view for a subset of users. During this period, affected users experienced full degradation of the page, with a \"Something went wrong\" error message.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a code error in a product update that was intended to introduce additional monitoring to track any partial failure to the page requests. The faulty code resulted in the page not rendering, instead of displaying empty data fields, due to partial failures; that, along with the fast rollout process, led to an increased impact.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have several testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the associated change was related to a very specific kind of legacy case that could not be detected by our automated continuous deployment suites and manual test scripts.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid this type of incident from occurring in the future:\n\n* Additional testing controls during the code development process.\n* Enhanced monitoring to detect regressions earlier during a release.\n* Improvements to deployment automations to reduce the risk of similar incidents in the future.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident.\n\n  \nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Some customers observed intermittent errors as services gradually recovered until 06:17 UTC.\n\nThe event was triggered by a faulty configuration change to our Content Delivery Network \\(CDN\\). The change included an invalid hostname which prevented customers from successfully connecting to [atlassian.net](http://atlassian.net/) domains.\n\nThe incident was detected within 1 minute by our monitoring systems and mitigated by rolling back the change, which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The acute impact was resolved in 10 minutes and all lingering errors resolved in 1 hour 38 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe acute impact occurred on September 22, 2025, between 04:38 UTC and 04:48 UTC to Confluence, Compass and Jira, including Jira Service Management. The incident caused service disruption to customers when they attempted to load those products in their browser or interact with APIs. Between 04:48 UTC and 06:17 UTC some customers continued to observe intermittent errors as services gradually recovered.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a change to the hostname configuration of our Content Delivery Network \\(CDN\\). As a result, the products mentioned could not receive connections, and the users received TLS handshake errors, followed by HTTP 503 and 403 errors.\n\nMore specifically a new CDN configuration contained a resource name which conflicted with the existing customer-serving CDN resource, and was able to be deployed, overwriting it. The root cause of the incident was the failure in the detection of the bug by our pre-deployment validations and tests.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that you rely on our products for your daily operations and productivity, and we sincerely apologize for any impact this disruption has had on you, your team or your organisation.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to help avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Improved pre-deployment change controls and testing.\n* Improved validation of target configurations before deployment to ensure customer-serving CDN resources cannot their hostnames changed.\n* Sharding of our CDN configuration to enable progressive changes.\n\nWe sincerely appreciate your understanding and patience as we improve our processes to provide a better customer experience.\n\nThank you,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

These settings can block media (images and videos) content from loading, uploading, or opening.\n\nThe issue is triggered by Edge's Strict tracking prevention incorrectly classifying Atlassian as advertising, impacting functionality.\n\nRecommended Workarounds:\n- Switch your tracking prevention settings from 'Strict' to the 'Balanced (Recommended)' mode in Edge.\n- Alternatively, add an 'Exception' for the URL you use to access Atlassian products.\n- Use a different browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.\n\nThis issue only affects Microsoft Edge. Other browsers are not affected by this issue.\nThank you for your patience as we work through this issue. We'll provide updates as they become available.",

          "body": "### Summary\n\nOn May 20, 2025, between 13:10 UTC and 22:12 UTC, a small subset of Atlassian customers using Jira Software and Jira Service Management products were unable to access certain functionality, such as creating, viewing, or editing boards, issues, filters, and Jira Service Management requests. The root cause was data duplication in our software related to upgrades of \\(non-faulty\\) third party apps.\n\nThe incident was detected within 4 minutes by Automated Monitoring, and mitigated through the subsequent 8 hours and 58 mins.\n\nFactors that prolonged the impact of the incident included:\n\n* An attempt to mitigate the issue by disabling the \\(non-faulty\\) apps was ineffective because the disablement mechanism was not integrated with the affected data source\n* Attempts to manually rectify the data in the database were hampered by the binary storage format used for the data \\(necessary for performance reasons\\)\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nDuring the impact period stated above, Jira Software and Jira Service Desk sites that had a specific version of the third party apps installed were impacted. For the duration of the incident, functionality such as creating, viewing, or editing of boards, issues, filters, and Jira Service Management requests was unavailable on those sites.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nDuring the process of version upgrade for the third party apps with dynamic modules, duplicated data was left behind due to a bug in Atlassian systems triggered during a prior upgrade.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified during development because of the specific sequence of events required to trigger the latent duplicate data to impact the product’s functioning.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Detecting and repairing duplicated data at the source\n* Updating the faulty “write” subsystem to prevent further duplication of data\n\nFurthermore, we are taking steps to enable swifter mitigation should such an incident occur in the future. We are:\n\n* Enhancing app disablement tooling \\(and its documentation\\) to make it simple and effective to deploy against this class of issue\n* Enhancing validation of the app upgrade process\n* Developing an affordance for viewing, repairing, and modifying specific app data\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
