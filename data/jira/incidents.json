          "body": "### Summary\n\nOn May 20, 2025, between 13:10 UTC and 22:12 UTC, a small subset of Atlassian customers using Jira Software and Jira Service Management products were unable to access certain functionality, such as creating, viewing, or editing boards, issues, filters, and Jira Service Management requests. The root cause was data duplication in our software related to upgrades of \\(non-faulty\\) third party apps.\n\nThe incident was detected within 4 minutes by Automated Monitoring, and mitigated through the subsequent 8 hours and 58 mins.\n\nFactors that prolonged the impact of the incident included:\n\n* An attempt to mitigate the issue by disabling the \\(non-faulty\\) apps was ineffective because the disablement mechanism was not integrated with the affected data source\n* Attempts to manually rectify the data in the database were hampered by the binary storage format used for the data \\(necessary for performance reasons\\)\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nDuring the impact period stated above, Jira Software and Jira Service Desk sites that had a specific version of the third party apps installed were impacted. For the duration of the incident, functionality such as creating, viewing, or editing of boards, issues, filters, and Jira Service Management requests was unavailable on those sites.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nDuring the process of version upgrade for the third party apps with dynamic modules, duplicated data was left behind due to a bug in Atlassian systems triggered during a prior upgrade.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified during development because of the specific sequence of events required to trigger the latent duplicate data to impact the product’s functioning.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Detecting and repairing duplicated data at the source\n* Updating the faulty “write” subsystem to prevent further duplication of data\n\nFurthermore, we are taking steps to enable swifter mitigation should such an incident occur in the future. We are:\n\n* Enhancing app disablement tooling \\(and its documentation\\) to make it simple and effective to deploy against this class of issue\n* Enhancing validation of the app upgrade process\n* Developing an affordance for viewing, repairing, and modifying specific app data\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The incident was triggered by the deployment of a monitoring library upgrade, which slowed the execution of all rules. This reduced the throughput of rule processing which resulted in rules being backed up and delayed. The change manifested in poor rule performance only during periods of high traffic. This incident occurred over two time windows. For the first incident window, backed-up rule executions began to reduce 4 hours 15 minutes after the first alert, and all rules had caught up 7 hours after the first alert. For the second incident window, backed-up rule executions began to reduce 1 hour, 50 minutes after the first alert, and all rules had caught up 10 hours after the first alert.\n\nThe root cause of both incidents was identified and a change to address it was deployed by 10am UTC on March 19, 2025.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe customer’s rules were delayed on average by 1.5 hours and up to 12 hours during both incident windows. A very small number of rules encountered the following error: “_The rule actor doesn't have permission to view the event that triggered this rule_.” This error occurred because of rate limiting implemented by an internal Atlassian service due to increased throughput resulting from our mitigation efforts. These rules failed to complete successfully. All other rules eventually ran successfully.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a change introduced to an Atlassian monitoring library, which significantly degraded the Automation rule engine's performance. The performance degradation prevented Automation's system from keeping pace with processing throughput, causing a back-up of executions and subsequent customer rule delays.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue didn’t manifest itself until our systems were at peak load.\n\nThe change to the Atlassian monitoring library that was the root cause of the incident has been fixed.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions that are designed to avoid a repeat of this type of incident:\n\n* Deploying the fixed monitoring library after thorough testing\n* Implementing additional monitoring and alerting to the area of our system affected with performance degradation\n* Introducing additional pre-deployment testing designed to identify performance degradations before they impact customers\n* Increasing rate limits of certain downstream Atlassian systems to reduce the likelihood of the rule failures that occurred in this incident\n* Increasing the processing capacity of parts of our system to reduce the impact of backed up rule executions\n\nWe apologize to customers whose automation rules were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps designed to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
