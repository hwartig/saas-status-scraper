This was caused by unexpected traffic and recent changes to automated scaling policies which resulted in nodes not being able to scale up quickly enough. The incident was detected within two minutes by automated monitoring and was mitigated by manually scaling up nodes which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was 19 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on March 7, 2024, between 12:02 pm UTC and 12:21 pm UTC, on Jira and Confluence products. The incident caused service disruption to some customers accessing the EU-central region. For Jira, the disruption caused core experiences of the product to be unavailable during this time. For Confluence, some non-core experiences were affected during this time.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThis incident was caused by unexpected traffic and recent changes to automated scaling policies which resulted in nodes not being able to scale up quickly enough in the EU-Central region. As a result, the Atlassian GraphQL Gateway could not service all requests in EU-Central, leading to parts of Jira being unavailable for some customers and degradation of non-core features in Confluence in the incident time period.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe understand that outages impact your productivity.\n\nWe have already implemented improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident and reduce the time to recovery. We have improved scaling out policies to be substantially more aggressive. This will help mitigate many different types of incidents.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### Summary\n\nOn February 29, 2024, between 05:11 and 08:46 UTC, customers of Jira Software, Jira Service Management, Jira Work Management, Jira Product Discovery, and Confluence experienced an incorrect data update of Automation Rules. This was due to an incomplete feature flag rollout and bugs in the data upgrade code. 99.99% of affected Automation Rules were remediated by 17:00 UTC on February 29, 2024. The remaining 0.01% of Rule Components were edited by users during the impacted time window and required a confirmation to ensure changes weren’t overridden. These customers were contacted proactively.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nSome Rules containing Issue Edit, Issue Create, or Issue Clone actions in Jira products had the Advanced Fields section removed. These Rules continued to run as if the Advanced Fields section were empty. In addition, for affected Issue Edit actions, Jira notifications were not sent.\n\nSome Rules using the Send Email action in Jira and Confluence had the “From name” field removed. Emails continued to be sent but fell back to the Automation default for the “From name” field.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nWe were in the process of rolling out a new feature for Automation, which required us to perform data upgrades, which could be risky as the current system would run the upgrades automatically upon Rule activity. In an attempt to minimize such risk, we used feature flags to better control when the upgrade occurred.\n\nHowever, there was an error in the feature flag configuration which resulted in the upgrades immediately kicking in. Additionally, there were bugs in these upgrades that resulted in overriding customers' saved values with default values. This incorrect configuration was used for Rule runs until recovery.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTION PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* We are changing the approach for upgrading Rule configurations to allow better testing and prevent accidental upgrades.\n* Improving feature flag rollout and verification processes to avoid such incorrect configurations.\n* Increasing the frequency of backups of the Automation Rule data.\n\nWe apologize to customers who were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the reliability of Automation.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### Summary\n\nOn February 28, 2024, between 12:17 UTC and 15:23 UTC, Jira and Confluence apps built on the Connect platform were unable to perform any actions on behalf of users. Some apps may have retried and later succeeded these actions, whereas others may have failed the request. The incident was detected within four minutes by automated monitoring of service reliability and mitigated by manual scaling of the service which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about three hours and six minutes.\n\n### **Technical Summary**\n\nOn February 28, 2024, between 12:17 UTC and 15:23 UTC, Jira and Confluence apps built on the Connect platform were unable to perform token exchanges specifically for the purpose of user impersonation requests initiated by the app. The event was triggered by the failure of the oauth-2-authorization-server service to scale as the load increased. The unavailability of this service and apps retrying failing requests created a feedback loop, compounding the impacts of the service not scaling. The problem impacted customers in all regions. The incident was detected within four minutes by automated monitoring of service reliability and mitigated by manual scaling of the service which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about three hours and six minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on February 28, 2024, between 12:17 UTC and 15:23 UTC, and impacted Connect apps for Jira and Confluence products that relied on the user impersonation feature\\_.\\_ The incident caused service disruption to customers in all regions. Apps that made requests to act on behalf of users would have seen some of their requests failing throughout the incident. Where apps had retry mechanisms in place, these requests may have eventually succeeded once the service was in a good state. Impacted apps received HTTP 502 and 503 errors as well as request timeouts when making requests to the oauth-2-authorization-server service.\n\nProduct functionality such as automation rules in Automation for Jira are partially built on the Connect platform, and some of these were impacted. During the impact window, Automation rules performing rule executions on behalf of a user instead of Automation for Jira failed to authenticate. Rules that failed were recorded in the Automation Audit Log. Additionally, manually triggered rules would have failed to trigger, these will not appear in the Automation Audit Log. Overall, this impacted approximately 2% of all rules run in the impact window. Automation for Confluence was not impacted.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an increase in traffic to the oauth-2-authorization-server service in the US-East region and the service not autoscaling in response to the increased load. As the service began to fail requests, apps retried the requests, which further increased the service load. By adding additional processing resources \\(scaling the nodes\\), the service was able to handle the increased load and restore availability.\n\nWhile we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the load conditions had not been encountered previously. The service has operated for many years in its current configuration and has never experienced this particular failure mode where traffic ramped faster than our ability to scale. As such, the scaling controls were not exercised and when required they did not proactively scale the oauth-2-authorization-server service due to the CPU scaling threshold never being reached.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* The CPU threshold for scaling the service has been lowered significantly so that scaling will begin much earlier as the service load increases in each region.\n* We are updating our scaling policy to switch to step scaling in order to more rapidly scale capacity if there are significant load increases.\n* We have increased the minimum number of nodes for the service and will monitor service behaviour to see what should be the optimal minimum scaling value.\n* Further analysis of rate limiting being triggered will be undertaken to determine if apps are responding to rate limiting appropriately. The service rate limiting is described in [https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/user-impersonation-for-connect-apps/#rate-limiting](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/user-impersonation-for-connect-apps/#rate-limiting).\n* Longer-term, network-based rate limiting will be explored to avoid a misbehaving app overloading the service.\n\nWe apologize to customers, partners, and developers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The event was triggered by a change to Atlassian's Network \\(Edge\\) infrastructure, where an incorrect security credential was deployed.  This impacted requests to Atlassian's Cloud originating from the Europe and South Asia regions. The incident was detected within 21 minutes by monitoring and mitigated by a failover to other Edge regions and a rollback of the failed deployment which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe failed change impacted 3 out of the 14 Atlassian Cloud regions \\(Europe/Frankfort, Europe/Dublin, and India/Mumbai\\). Between 21/02/2023 2:30am and 04:15am UTC, end-users may have experience intermittent errors or complete service disruption for multiple Cloud products. As the traffic is directed to Atlassian Cloud using DNS latency-based records, only the traffic originating from locations close to Europe and India was impacted.   \n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nA change to our Network Infrastructure used faulty credentials. As a result, customer authentication requests could not be validated, and requests were returned with a 500 or 503 errors. After investigation, it was found that the health-check and tests which should have prevented the faulty credentials to reach the production environment, contained a bug and never indicating a fault.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified in our dev and staging environments because the new credentials were only valid for production.  \n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Improving end-to-end healthchecks\n* Faster rollback of our infrastructure deployment\n* Improved monitoring\n\nFurthermore, we deploy our changes progressively \\(by cloud region\\) to avoid broad impact but in this case, our detection and health-checks did not work as expected. To minimise the impact of breaking changes to our environments, we will implement additional preventative measures such as:\n\n* Canary and shakedown deployments with automated rollback\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Active domain names were incorrectly deleted during this event. This impacted all cloud customers across all regions. The issue was identified and resolved through the rollback of the faulty deployment to restore the domain names and Atlassian systems to a stable state. The time to resolution was two hours and 58 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nExternal customers started reporting issues with Atlassian cloud products at 20:52 UTC. The impact of the failed change led to performance degradation or in some cases, complete service disruption. Symptoms experienced by end-users were unsuccessful page loads and/or failed interactions with our cloud products.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nAs part of a security and compliance uplift, we had scheduled the deletion of unused and legacy domain names that were being used for internal service-to-service connections. Active domain names were incorrectly deleted during this operation.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. The detection was delayed because existing testing & monitoring focused on service health rather than the entire system’s availability.\n\nTo prevent a recurrence of this type of incident, we are implementing the following improvement measures:\n\n* Canary checks to monitor the entire system availability.\n* Faster rollback procedures for this type of service impact.\n* Stricter change control procedures for infrastructure modifications.\n* Migration of all DNS records to centralised management and stricter access controls on modification to DNS records.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\n‌\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The impact of this incident has been mitigated and our monitoring tools confirm that the success-rate is back to the pre-incident behaviour. It impacted 16 apps according to our logs, where these apps saw a reduced success rate of storage.get API calls, as listed in https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/runtime-reference/storage-api-basic.\n\nAs part of Forge's preparation to support Data Residency, Forge hosted storage has been undergoing a platform and data migration for storing app data. As part of this migration we do comparison checks for data consistency between the old and new platform. The previous incident earlier, https://developer.status.atlassian.com/incidents/9q71ytpjhbtl, had put the data on the new platform out of sync and so comparisons of the data from the old and new platform started showing failures and the migration logic retries on failures to test for consistency issues. This retry behaviour increased latency of these requests which led to 16 apps receiving an increased number of 504 timeout errors. \n\nChecking synchronously was identified by the team as a bug and should have been async. Once the root cause was identified we moved our backing platform rollout to a previous stage. The rollout is split into several stages. The issues we were having were on our blocking stage where we make calls to both the old and new platform and wait for both to complete so we can test any performance issues in the new platform before using it as our source of truth. It was in this blocking stage where we had a bug that included waiting on comparisons when it should've been async.\n\nTo recover, we reverted back to our shadow mode stage. In this stage, all operations to the new platform are asynchronous, including comparisons that were blocking in the other stage and resulted in timeout issues and 504 errors being sent to apps. This is the state that Forge hosted storage has been in for several months without any problems.\n\nHere is the timeline of the impact:\n- On 2024-02-05 at 06:42 PM UTC, impact started with comparisons start happening on out of sync data in blocking mode\n- On 2024-02-05 at 08:57 PM UTC, impact was detected to API by our monitoring systems\n- On 2024-02-05 at 11:34 PM UTC, rollout to new platform was reverted to known stable state and impact ended\n\nWe will release a public incident review, PIR, here in the upcoming weeks for this and the incident that happened earlier, https://developer.status.atlassian.com/incidents/9q71ytpjhbtl. We will detail all that we can about what caused the issue, and what we are doing to prevent it from happening again.\n\nWe apologise for any inconveniences this may have caused our customers and the developer community and committed to preventing further issues with our hosted storage capability.",

          "body": "# Summary\n\nOn January 18, 2024, starting at 06:34 UTC, customers using Atlassian Marketplace and the Jira family of products may have experienced intermittent failures.\n\nA scheduled database upgrade on an internal Atlassian Marketplace service resulted in degraded performance for that service. This degraded performance manifested in increasing response times and eventually time outs. This service degradation then cascaded upstream and resulted in requests timing out across the Jira family of products, impacting product experiences.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Jira family:\n\nOn January 18, 2024, at 07:14 UTC, the impact on product experiences hit critical alerting thresholds. \n\nThis impact would resulted in performance degradation, service unavailability or in some instances, full service disruption. Customers would have experienced this as failed page loads or failed interactions with the products. \n\nAll end user impact related to product functionality was fully resolved by 10:30 UTC.\n\n## Marketplace:\n\nOn January 18, 2024, starting from 06:34 UTC, there were impacts to customer functionality related to app management \\(install, trial, uninstall, update, purchase\\). There were also impacts to Marketplace partner functionality such as app management and account management.\n\nWe resolved the underlying service degradation and restored full service by 15:13 UTC. We then monitored closely for further impact until we officially closed the incident at 16:15 UTC.\n\n# Root Cause\n\nThe issue was caused by a scheduled database upgrade within the central service that supports the Atlassian Marketplace. The upgrade occurred during a scheduled maintenance window between 06:30 UTC and 08:30 UTC on January 18, 2024.\n\nOne of the database upgrade steps triggered degraded performance of the Marketplace service. As the performance degraded this created back pressure on clients of this service. This back pressure eventually drove request timeouts. Our global edge compounded this issue by retrying on timeout, which further exacerbated the issue and increased the load on the service.\n\nOverall this resulted in degrading performance and an effective outage on this service. Attempts to rollback the change were not immediately effective under heavy load.\n\nAtlassian products are dependent on this Marketplace service for some user-facing capabilities. In the case of this incident, there is a licensing check for some marketplace apps from Jira family into the back-end service.\n\nJira should degrade gracefully when there is degradation or outages in downstream services. For this dependency we don't have sufficient isolation of downstream impact from user experience impact on the front end which caused the impact to experiences in the Jira family. We were able to recover Jira ahead of the marketplace service recovery by breaking that hard dependency without losing end user capability.\n\n# Remedial actions & next steps\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because of a difference in load between our staging and production environments.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n## For Marketplace:\n\n* Improve concurrency handling within the service, tune and test the system for scale and performance, and apply protective measures like rate limiting.\n* Harden the database migration procedure to avoid unexpected downtime, including monitoring for expected vs unexpected alerts during upgrades.\n* Implement faster rollback / roll forward procedures for this type of service impact. \n\n## For Jira:\n\n* Isolate impact from this dependency into the product by routing through a single logical proxy responsible for ensuring appropriate circuit-breaking behaviour and timeouts.\n* Discover and identify and remediate any other potential similar class of issue. \n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Customers' user search results failed or were delayed as Atlassian's service returning user search results was degraded in several regions.\n\nThe incident originated from a computationally intensive operation that was triggered multiple times in rapid succession, resulting in degraded performance of Atlassian's user search service across several regions. Notably, customers in the EU west region were most affected. The incident was detected within 2 minutes by automated monitoring, and our team promptly took action by recovering unhealthy systems and scaling up the service's infrastructure temporarily. The resolution process concluded in 3 hours and 06 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between Dec 18, 2023, between 12:29 p.m. UTC and Dec 18, 2023, 3:35 p.m. UTC. The Incident caused service disruption to cloud customers worldwide. Customers experienced delayed or failed user searches when using the following Atlassian cloud products:\n\n* Atlas\n* Bitbucket Cloud\n* Compass\n* Confluence Cloud\n* Jira Service Management\n* Jira Software\n* Jira Work Management\n* Jira Product Discovery\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident stemmed from Atlassian's user search service receiving commands to process multiple computationally intensive operations in rapid succession. These operations were directed at the same customer data set, and therefore overloaded resources within a clustered database system, leading to memory exhaustion and subsequent unresponsiveness to user search requests. \n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nTo prevent a recurrence of such incidents, we are implementing the following measures:\n\n* Implement a mechanism to queue computationally intensive operations in order to avoid overloading the resources within the systems and process them without impact on customer experience.\n* Fine-tune our clustered database settings to mitigate the impact of resource exhaustion on the overall system. \n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were affected during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the service’s resiliency.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

It was mitigated by excluding redundant validations from the custom domain verification job which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 30 hours.\n\nNote: the initially published timeframe of the incident was incorrect and was adjusted together with time to resolution.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between October 23, 2023 9pm UTC and October 25 3am UTC on Jira family products, including Jira Service Management, Jira Software and Jira Work Management. The incident caused service disruption to customers who have notifications from custom email domains enabled for their Jira products as email notifications were being sent from the default [atlassian.net](http://atlassian.net) domain instead of the custom domain configured by the customer.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a change to the service responsible for custom domain email notifications lifecycle that inadvertently enabled SPF record validation as part of a daily validation job. As a result, previously working custom domain configuration transitioned to an unverified state for some Atlassian customers, resulting in notifications from Jira products being sent from [atlassian.net](http://atlassian.net) domain instead of a previously configured custom domain.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are continuously improving our system's resiliency. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Improve monitoring and alerting for custom domains lifecycle to detect such regressions before they reach production.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
