On July 6, 2023, from 03:52 to 15:11 UTC, we experienced an issue with an upgraded version of a third-party tool that functions as our internal artifact management system. Despite our monitoring system identifying the incident within two minutes, this issue led to the degradation of the scaling capabilities of our internal hosting platform, resulting in service degradation or outages for customers of Atlassian cloud.\n\nIn response to this situation, we are taking immediate measures to enhance the stability of our system and prevent similar issues from re-occurring.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThis incident affected multiple regions and products due to the diminished scaling capabilities of our internal hosting platform. In most products and offerings, customers faced reduced functionality, slower response times, and limited access to specific features.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe root cause of the incident was the introduction of new functionality in a third-party tool that functions as our internal artifact management system. It led to an unexpected increase in the load on the primary database of the artifact system.\n\nUpon identifying and localizing the problem, we promptly adjusted the system configuration to regain stability.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nOver the next months, we will enact a temporary freeze on non-critical upgrades of the artifact management system, and we will focus our efforts on three high-priority initiatives:\n\n1. **Enhancing system scaling:** We prioritized work ensuring that downtime in a critical infrastructure component does not affect the scaling of other components. We expect to complete this initiative within the next two months.\n2. **Reducing interdependencies:** We are working to mitigate the risk of potential cascading failures by ensuring that significant system components are able to operate independently in the case of issues. Initiatives 1 and 2 are already in progress but have been given priority to be completed as soon as possible.\n3. **Strengthening testing procedures:** Alongside these initiatives, we are addressing the need for even more stringent testing procedures than we already have in place to prevent potential issues in future updates. We are committed to collaborating closely with our technology partners to ensure the most optimal experience for our customers.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience caused by this incident and appreciate your understanding. Our team is dedicated to continually improving our systems and processes to provide you with the exceptional service you deserve. Thank you for your continued support and trust in us.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn June 13 2023, from 6:49 PM UTC to June 14, 2023, 02:20 AM UTC, Atlassian customers using Jira Software, Jira Service Management, Jira Work Management, Confluence and Trello with services hosted in AWS us-east-1 region were impacted by Automation rule degradation. This event was triggered by an increased error rates and latencies for AWS Lambda function invocations in the us-east-1 region. Some other AWS services also experienced increased error rates and latencies as a result of degraded Lambda functions invocations.  This incident was automatically detected by multiple monitoring systems within 6 minutes, paging on-call teams. Recovery of the affected AWS Lambda service began after 116 minutes at June 13th 8:45 PM UTC.  Full recovery of all AWS services occurred at 10:37 PM UTC June 13th after the backlog of asynchronous Lambda events had been processed. Some Jira tenants with large event backlogs experienced delays in running schedule-based rule reruns. Full recovery of all Atlassian Cloud services was notified at June 14, 2023, 02:20 AM UTC.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between June 13, 2023, 06:49 PM UTC and June 14, 2023, 02:20 AM UTC.  Product-specific impacts are listed below.\n\n* Jira Software, Jira Service Management,  Jira Work Management - Automation rules were not executed for 2 hours between Jun 13, 06:49 PM UTC and Jun 13, 08:45 PM UTC.  Jira automation events generated during this period were unable to be rerun.  When AWS Lambda recovered delays were still experienced in our schedule-based and event-based rules for some larger tenants due to a large backlog of events. Full recovery was at June 14, 2023, 02:20 AM UTC.\n* Confluence - Automation rules were not executed for 2 hours between Jun 13, 06:49 PM UTC and Jun 13, 08:45 PM UTC.  On AWS service restoration Confluence automation recovered and Confluence automation events generated during this period were rerun and processed.  Full recovery was at June 14, 2023, 12:41 AM UTC.\n* Jira Product Discovery - Automation rules were not executed for 2 hours between Jun 13, 06:49 PM UTC and Jun 13, 08:45 PM UTC. Jira automation events generated during this period were unable to be rerun.  Sending feedback/filing a support ticket from the application did not work. \n* Trello -  Email to board delays, card covers image upload failures, attachment preview generation failures, board background upload failures, custom sticker images upload failures, custom emoji upload failures. Trello automation was unaffected. Full recovery was at June 13, 2023, 10:08 PM UTC.\n\nThe service disruption lasted for 7 hours and 1 minutes between June 13, 2023, 06:49 PM UTC and June 14, 2023, 02:20 AM UTC and caused service disruption to customers with services hosted in the US-EAST-1 region.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nAtlassian uses Amazon Web Services \\(AWS\\) as a cloud service provider. The root cause was an issue with a subsystem responsible for capacity management for AWS Lambda in US-EAST-1 Region, which also impacted 104 AWS services.  This impacted Automation rules as the service is hosted exclusively in this region.\n\nThere were no relevant Atlassian-driven events in the lead-up that have been identified to cause or contribute to this incident.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Increase reliability of message delivery and recoverability from Jira to Automation platform to improve recovery times. \n* Create a plan for multi-region impact mitigation for Automation.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Automation events for Confluence during that time have been reprocessed, however, events for Jira were not received and can't be recovered. After the AWS services came back online, Automation started processing any events triggered after 8:45PM UTC. Due to the volume, this caused some events to become backlogged, however, these have now been processed successfully. All new executions after the recovery are confirmed operating normally.

The incident was detected within three minutes by automated monitoring and mitigated by a rollback of the change which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour and 32 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe impact across products was:\n\n* Bitbucket - Bitbucket Pipelines self-hosted builds were failing, access to Git LFS failed and cloud-hosted builds were delayed.\n* Confluence, Jira Align, Jira Service Management, Jira Software, Jira Work Management, Jira Product Discovery, and Atlas - media capabilities \\(images, videos, documents, audio\\) were affected and it was not possible to upload, download or view existing media attachments or files.\n\nThe service disruption lasted for one hour and 32 minutes between May 15, 2023, 02:36 and May 15, 2023, 04:08 UTC and caused service disruption to customers with services hosted in the us-west-1 region.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an attempted migration of a service to a new network segment. As part of this migration, a DNS record pointing to the old network segment was not updated, which resulted in failure when the old network stack was removed. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified as moving services across network segments is not a regular activity and is difficult to accurately replicate in a test environment. To mitigate against these types of issues, we made this change using blue/green deployment practices but failed to run adequate verification steps before decommissioning the old stack.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Reviewing our systems that decommission service stacks and implementing checks that customer traffic is no longer being served prior to decommissioning the stacks; and\n* As part of our service network migration process, we are adding steps to identify when there are associated DNS records that require attention.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **CONTEXT**\n\nAtlassian Cloud products, applications, the customer experiences they provide, as well as supporting services and Atlassian’s own internal tooling rely on compute and data workloads deployed in Amazon Web Services \\(AWS\\) Virtual Private Cloud \\(VPC\\).\n\nCritical to the function of these applications is the network communication between them, as well as to the Internet and AWS-managed services. This communication depends on DNS resolution, which applications perform by querying a DNS server to translate service names into network addresses they can connect to.\n\nTo facilitate DNS resolution across multiple accounts and VPCs, Atlassian operates [centralized EC2 \\(Elastic Compute Cloud\\) DNS servers](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-centralize-dns-management-in-a-multi-account-environment/) in each AWS region we serve customers from.\n\nAtlassian is currently in the process of migrating from this centralized infrastructure to a more resilient distributed solution that leverages [AWS-managed VPC resolver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#AmazonDNS) in a [Shared VPC architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9NMA3ACZDM). However, a number of internal applications and services still rely on the EC2-based solution.\n\nThe EC2-based DNS servers utilize [security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html), which are subject to [connection tracking allowance limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html)instrumented by AWS.\n\n### **INCIDENT SUMMARY**\n\nOn November 22, 2022, between 19:39 and 21:28 UTC, some Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket customers experienced varying levels of degradation across our products and services, including partner apps and integrations. The incident was detected within nine minutes by an automated monitoring system and resolved within one hour and 49 minutes.\n\nThe event was triggered by Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure within the AWS us-east-1 region encountering a network connection tracking allowance limit. Despite the fault being localized to one region, there was a global impact for customers whose data resided in us-east-1, as well as Atlassian products which have unique dependencies on that region.\n\nThe issue was initially mitigated by scaling up the DNS infrastructure, which increased the connection tracking allowance limit and returned Atlassian products to a healthy state. The underlying issue has since been resolved by a configuration change and cannot reoccur.\n\nThe incident was not caused by an attack and it was not a security issue. Atlassian customer data remains secure.\n\nWe deeply value the trust placed in Atlassian and apologize to customers who were affected by the event.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe impact occurred on November 22, 2022, between 19:39 and 21:28 UTC, for a total of one hour and 49 minutes. Some Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket customers experienced service degradation ranging from intermittent access to a complete outage. Customers experienced error pages or very slow responses in applications and browsers, as well as 5xx response codes from our APIs.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident occurred as connections through Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure reached a new daily peak due to steady traffic growth. As a result, [a limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#connection-tracking-throttling) on the number of simultaneous network connections [tracked by an AWS EC2 security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html) was encountered. Upon reaching this limit, DNS packets were dropped, meaning services were unable to resolve network addresses which resulted in application failures. Services retried their DNS queries upon receiving a SERVFAIL response or query timeout, which created even more connections - compounding the problem.\n\nDuring the incident, Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure in the AWS us-east-1 region was unable to service up to 90% of DNS resolution requests.\n\nWe were not aware of how close our infrastructure was to the security group connection tracking limit because utilization of this allowance is not currently observable.\n\nTroubleshooting took an extended period of time because EC2 network allowance packet drops \\(as a result of encountering this limit\\) [were not actively monitored](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-network-performance-ena.html) by Atlassian.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nAtlassian acknowledges that outages like this one impact the productivity and business of our customers. Since this incident:\n\n* We have deployed an immediate change to prevent traffic through Atlassian’s EC2-based DNS infrastructure from [consuming the security group connection allowance limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#untracked-connections). As a result of this change, this incident cannot reoccur.\n* We are investigating ways to improve our visibility into the utilization of AWS network allowance limits and will [monitor packet drops](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-network-performance-ena.html) due to them. \n* We are continuing our migration of internal services away from the EC2-based DNS infrastructure involved in this incident to a new, distributed architecture that is not subject to these network limits.\n\nAgain, we apologize to those customers whose services were impacted during this incident.\n\nThank you,  \nAtlassian Customer Support",
