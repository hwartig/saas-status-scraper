At 17:01 the issue was escalated to our major incident team. Initial investigations indicated the issue coincided with an update to to the Mural web application earlier in the day. Following the update, a higher volume of web traffic was being generated. This triggered security alerts in our firewall and blocked Mural users from logging in.\n\nAt 17:18 we adapted the web traffic thresholds in line with the new expected volume of traffic. This enabled Mural users to log in again and restored full service.\n\n‌\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis incident impacted logins from 16:15 UTC to 17:18 UTC, for a total of 1 hour 3 minutes of service interruption.\n\n‌\n\n**What we've done to avoid this happening again**\n\nThe previous firewall ruleset had a low tolerance for deviations from the expected volume of web traffic.

Initial investigations indicated the cause was an issue with our cloud provider. Shortly after we received confirmation from our cloud provider that routine server maintenance had had an unexpected impact on the availability of data hosted in one of their facilities. At 06:55 UTC MURAL implemented a workaround to re-route traffic and restore service via a secondary server. At 07:25 UTC our cloud provider confirmed that full service had been restored on the primary server and we were able to revert the earlier change.\n\n‌\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis incident impacted service availability from 06:25 UTC to 06:55 UTC, for a total of 30 minutes of downtime. No data was lost, however MURAL was not accessible during this time.\n\n‌\n\n**What we've done to avoid this happening again**\n\nWe have improved automated monitoring and notifications to include this particular scenario, to ensure we can restore service faster in the event this should occur again.",

We determined that the issues were being caused by a recent code change which unexpectedly impacted our infrastructure capacity. We were able to provisionally mitigate this by increasing capacity, resolving the issue definitively through an updated code change.\n\n‌\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis incident impacted service availability from 09:43 UTC to 10:42 UTC, for a total of 1 hour of intermittent downtime. No data was lost, however some members would have experienced troubles accessing their MURAL data.\n\n‌\n\n**What we’ve done to avoid this happening again**\n\nWe are documenting the constraints identified through this outage as guidance for future changes. In addition to this we are reviewing our automated infrastructure capacity management to ensure we stay within acceptable parameters.\n\nWe are also reviewing protocols to maintain system stability, should this specific issue occur again.",

As a precaution, our email service provider suspended MURAL’s account. This resulted in MURAL product emails \\(for example: invitations to join a mural\\) not sending.\n\nMURAL worked with our email service provider to restore service as quickly as possible. Together with our service provider we implemented a fix at 02:50 UTC on June 18th, which restored full service and allowed the pending emails to be sent. We continued to monitor the results of the fix until 04:00 UTC, at which time the incident was closed.\n\n‌\n\n**Summary**\n\nMURAL’s platform remained available throughout this incident.

At 08:48 UTC we confirmed this was an issue affecting a significant proportion of MURAL users and escalated this to our incident response team to commence investigations.\n\nAt 10:25 UTC our cloud provider confirmed there was an issue with their portal \\(see [https://status.azure.com/en-gb/status/history/](https://status.azure.com/en-gb/status/history/) for more details\\). This was confirmed to be the root cause of the issue affecting MURAL users.\n\nAt 12:16 UTC, in collaboration with our cloud provider, we successfully updated our connection to the Azure portal. By 12:50 UTC full connectivity and service in MURAL had been restored. \n\n‌\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis incident resulted in 5 hours 2 mins of downtime.

Authentication requests were being redirected from their customer tenants to the main [app.mural.co](http://app.mural.co) tenant, resulting in their users being unable to log in. Initial reports of this were received from MURAL customers on Sunday May 1st. Further reports were received on Monday May 2nd, at which point the issue was classified as a major incident and our task force was engaged.\n\n‌\n\n**Summary**\n\nMURAL’s task force started investigating at 13:58 UTC on Monday May 2nd. The cause of the issue was identified as being an incorrect configuration in how users on custom tenants were being routed through the login process. Once the issue was identified, a fix was rolled out at 14:07 UTC. This immediately corrected the login flow for clients using BYOK.\n\n‌\n\n‌**What we've done to avoid this happening again**\n\nParts of the login flow for BYOK clients had been hard-coded. We have changed this to be dynamically generated, reducing the risk of code-based errors. We are also researching avenues to improve the automated monitoring of login issues.",

The change proceeded as planned and no immediate issues were detected during our post-release checks.\n\nLater that day our engineers detected unexpected behavior with MURAL search results. An immediate decision was taken to roll back to the previous version. The process to roll back the upgrade was unsuccessful. Our team worked through the weekend to restore search functionality within MURAL workspaces. Public API endpoints for searching were however inoperative.\n\nOur team continued working through the next week to identify the root of the issue with ElasticSearch. On Friday, February 25, the indexes were fully rebuilt on a new ES6 cluster, tested successfully in beta, and then enabled in production. This restored full functionality using ES6, including the public API endpoints for search.\n\n‌\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis incident resulted in a partial outage for search functionality within MURAL workspaces, lasting 54 hours and 56 minutes. MURAL remained operational throughout this incident and members were able to log in and access their data.\n\n‌\n\n**What we've done to avoid this happening again**\n\nWe are re-evaluating our upgrade process for ES6 to ES7 to ensure this does not happen again during the next upgrade.",

During our initial investigations we were unable to reproduce the issue. We continued to receive reports and at 09:40 UTC on November 19 2021 we classified this as a critical incident. The relevant code for displaying icons was retained and no data was lost, however the icons were not being displayed.\n\n‌\n\n**Details and corrective actions**\n\nAt 16:26 UTC we updated the configuration for the Noun Project integration, which restored full service with no data loss.\n\n‌\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis incident resulted in a partial outage for a core service, lasting 7 hours and 44 minutes. MURAL remained operational throughout this incident and members were able to log in and access their data; however, some Noun Project icons were not visible in the search menu or on murals.\n\n‌\n\n**What we've done to avoid this happening again**\n\nWe have resolved the configuration issue and restored full service with the use of icons. We are working on several short- and medium-term initiatives to improve the reliability of this service going forward.",

Once the original operation finished at 22:42, the database returned to normal operations and access to the MURAL application was restored. \n\n‌\n\n**Details and corrective actions** \n\nThe specifics of how the operation was performed resulted in a less-known bug on our database server to be triggered. We now understand the steps and will update our processes to avoid repeating this scenario.\n\n‌\n\n**Summary** \n\nThe outage resulted in 50 minutes of downtime. No data from prior to the outage was lost during this time. \n\n‌\n\n**What we've done to avoid this happening again** \n\nWe have updated our processes for running database operations to avoid triggering the now-known bug, and will be performing an upgrade to fully mitigate the issue.

A very large number of simultaneous operations in a single workspace, specifically joining a workspace and moving content between workspaces, generated write conflicts and resulted in the primary database server locking up. Users that were logged in at the time had their sessions terminated and no new login requests could be processed.\n\n**‌Details and corrective actions**  \nWe identified the cause of the incident and initiated a fail-over to a new primary database server at 06:44 UTC. This was completed at 07:35 UTC, at which point full service was restored. We immediately started investigating the root cause of the write conflicts and optimizing the workflows for joining workspaces to prevent this from impacting system availability again.\n\n‌**Summary**  \nThe outage resulted in 1 hour and 20 minutes of downtime. No data from prior to the outage was lost during this time.\n\n‌**What we’ve done to avoid this happening again**  \nAs an immediate action we implemented an optimization to the workflow for joining the impacted workspace. We are working towards applying this update to all workspaces in an upcoming release.",

A bulk action in billing groups resulted in the primary database server locking up. Users that were logged in at the time had their sessions terminated and no new login requests could be processed.\n\n‌\n\n**Details and corrective actions**\n\nAt 17:32 UTC we initiated a fail-over to a new primary database server. This was completed at 17:46 UTC, at which time full service was restored with no data loss.\n\n‌\n\n**What happened next?**\n\nAt 23:33 UTC we experienced a similar set of events and the database on the new primary database server became unresponsive.\n\n‌\n\n**Details and corrective actions**\n\nAt 23:42 UTC we initiated a fail-over to another new primary database server. This was completed at 23:56 UTC, at which time full service was restored with no data loss.\n\n‌\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe first outage resulted in 16 minutes of downtime, with another 23 minutes of downtime for the second outage.\n\n‌\n\n**What we’ve done to avoid this happening again**\n\nFollowing the outage on May 19, we performed a series of maintenance operations over the weekend of May 22-23 to significantly improve our database performance. This reduced the likelihood of a similar outage in future, whilst not entirely eliminating it.\n\nAs an immediate remedial action, we have temporarily disabled the bulk change functionality in billing groups \\(an Enterprise Network feature\\). This functionality is being refactored and will be re-released as soon as possible. \n\nWe are also conducting a comprehensive review of bulk operations within the MURAL platform to ensure this cannot happen again.",

This procedure involved a high number of concurrent operations, which generated unexpected high load on our main database servers, causing the primary to become unresponsive while processing said operations. This resulted in the MURAL application being unavailable for all users.\n\nDetails and corrective actions: \n\nAt 11:06 Pacific Time we initiated a manual failover to a new primary database server. This was completed at 11:17 Pacific Time and we were able to restore full service, without any loss of data.\n\nWhat we’ve done to avoid this happening again:\n\nWe have temporarily restricted the procedure that triggered this situation, while we review and upgrade how it works. This is aimed also at improving our handling of massive bulk data operations to prevent them from impacting service availability.\n\nMURAL administrators can continue to disable users on an individual or pick-list basis, via the admin interface.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience caused by this incident and thank you for your understanding.",

The list of IP addresses for that customer contained an incorrectly formatted IP range, causing an exception in the code that updates our firewall settings. Our firewall configuration system responded to this exception in the most conservative manner possible, temporarily shutting off all customer access.  \n  \nAt 8:27am Pacific Time on Feb 22, 2021 we corrected the malformed entry and re-applied the IP Allowlisting settings for the customer in question, restoring access to the system.\n\n**What we’ve done to avoid this happening again:**  \nAt 5:14am Pacific Time on Feb 23, 2021 we published an update to our Firewall configuration system. This update provides more granular exception handling and ensures that Firewall updates will apply only to the customer being modified.",

The rest of the servers were behaving properly and most users were able to collaborate normally.\n\nThe cause for these increased response times for said pub-sub service was an unplanned server patching performed by our Cloud Provider outside of our requested maintenance window.Some API servers were affected with increased load for some requests that relied on said service.\n\nWe immediately triggered a rotation for those affected servers. As some servers were rotated our API became slow while the backing pub-sub service continued to have high latency.\n\nOnce we noticed that our cloud provider had performed unannounced patching of one of our pub-sub servers, we rotated it as well. This process takes a while but once it completed, dependent services started showing expected latency once again.\n\nWe understand your frustration if this caused any inconvenience.

          "body": "## **Postmortem of Service Outage**\n\nOn Friday, April 17th, 2020, we experienced an extended outage. The outage intermittently blocked access for users to our platform over the course of 14 hours. No data was lost or compromised during this time.\n\nWe know many customers were counting on MURAL to support important work with their teams and customers. We sincerely apologize for the downtime.\n\n### **Root Cause Analysis**\n\nMURAL uses a MongoDB cluster as its primary data store, with a replica set distributed between geographically diverse Azure datacenters. We chose this architecture because it best matches the dynamic, schemaless nature of MURAL documents, and because it can provide high availability, data durability, and robust disaster recovery capabilities.\n\nThis event was initially triggered by an issue with our database provider that caused our cluster to lose connectivity to a secondary node for an extended period of time. After the secondary node automatically restarted, it could not join the cluster due to a rare networking issue.\n\nOur MongoDB cluster was running a version that has a default configuration setting that causes the entire replica set to stop accepting data when it cannot verify that data was received and stored by a majority of data nodes in the cluster for an extended period of time.\n\nThis default configuration in conjunction with the replica set topology that we were using, resulted in failed writes under a high load situation when a secondary node was unreachable for an extended period of time and other nodes in the cluster were falling behind in the data replication process.\n\nNormal operations were restored when we recovered the faulty node, joined it to the cluster, and intentionally severed the link to our failover region, causing the replica set topology to reset to a working configuration.\n\n### **Why did it take us so long to fix the issue?**\n\n1. Our team was unaware of the MongoDB default configuration implications with our cluster topology under node failures. This issue is uncommon and requires a rare set of circumstances to result in the outcome we experienced.\n2. To accelerate a resolution we escalated this issue with our managed service provider. Their guidance focused our team's attention on possible application errors as the cause for the unusual behavior. After investigating thoroughly, it was determined this was not the cause of the issue.\n3. We followed our procedures for diagnosing and repairing this type of issue, including working closely with the relevant providers we rely on. Several of our efforts seemed to resolve the issue temporarily. Each attempt took additional time, since our database footprint is huge at this point.\n\n### **What are we changing to avoid this happening again?**\n\nWe have scaled up all of the hardware in our MongoDB cluster. MURAL is now running on hardware that is 4x more powerful than what it was prior to the increase of usage we’ve seen as a result of COVID-19. This change will give us a comfortable buffer to make changes as usage continues to grow.\n\nWe have also audited and updated our cluster topology and configuration to make sure it will be immune to similar edge cases in the future. Our monitoring systems and corresponding operational procedures have been updated and enhanced, as well.\n\nAdditionally, we are continuing to work on new strategic initiatives around scalability and disaster recovery. We will have more to share on those soon.\n\nWe deeply appreciate the trust our customers have placed in our software and service, and we will continue to work hard to provide the best and most reliable experience we can.\n\nIf you have any questions, you may contact me directly at: [pato@mural.co](mailto:pato@mural.co).\n\nSincerely,\n\nPatricio Jutard      \nCTO - MURAL",
