Post-migration checks indicated all functions were performing as expected. On Monday, November 13th, some Mural customers reported difficulty logging into the Mural web application. Mural’s incident response team was immediately engaged in troubleshooting these reports.\n\nInitial investigations revealed that the platform upgrade over the preceding weekend had incorrect settings for the DNS infrastructure and a key backend application's auto-scaling. This resulted in unstable connections for some users.\n\nDuring the course of this investigation, we also discovered that load balancing improvements for clients with specific network and application configurations altered how the client’s IP address was interpreted by our system, preventing access for such clients. \n\nOur incident response team addressed the auto-scaling configuration, resolving DNS-related issues and restored access for the majority of users. Next, a new load-balancing configuration underwent adjustments and testing to restore stable connections for the previously-impacted users.\n\nThe total time from when our incident response team started working on this incident, to deploying the final fix, was 9 hours 40 minutes.\n\n**What we’ve done to prevent this happening again:**\n\nAs part of Mural’s post-incident procedure, our engineering teams conducted a thorough review to identify the root cause and outline necessary improvements. 8 separate changes have been identified and will be implemented in the coming weeks. These changes cover monitoring to detect this scenario sooner, enhanced post-migration checks to ensure this scenario and others are included in our use cases and reviewing our migration process to reduce the risks.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this incident may have caused and sincerely thank your patience whilst we worked through this incident.",

By 11:25 UTC we identified a potential cause of the issue and started preparing a fix. At 11:45 UTC we made the decision to roll back the change from the previous day, which was completed at 12:15 UTC.  \n  \nAs of 12:15 UTC login behavior returned to normal parameters.‌  \n  \n**‌What we've done to avoid this happening again**  \nThe change we implemented on Thursday afternoon was rolled back and we are preparing a new change that will avoid impacting the SAML SSO login flow.",

This had the effect of redirect URLs for these apps not being returned in the API response, and authentication failing. After the problem was identified, the duplicate documents were removed and normal integration and Mural API app authentication was restored at 13:45 UTC.\n\n**Summary**\n\nAccess to Mural via 3rd party integrations, Microsoft Teams and Zoom, was interrupted from 05:43 UTC to 13:45 UTC for a total of 8 hours and 2 minutes.\n\n**What we've done to avoid this happening again**\n\nWe are developing more robust test mechanism for database migrations and expanding our documentation around the steps to follow.",

Initial investigations indicated the cause was an issue with our cloud provider. Shortly after we received confirmation from our cloud provider that routine server maintenance had had an unexpected impact on the availability of data hosted in one of their facilities. At 06:55 UTC MURAL implemented a workaround to re-route traffic and restore service via a secondary server. At 07:25 UTC our cloud provider confirmed that full service had been restored on the primary server and we were able to revert the earlier change.\n\n‌\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis incident impacted service availability from 06:25 UTC to 06:55 UTC, for a total of 30 minutes of downtime. No data was lost, however MURAL was not accessible during this time.\n\n‌\n\n**What we've done to avoid this happening again**\n\nWe have improved automated monitoring and notifications to include this particular scenario, to ensure we can restore service faster in the event this should occur again.",

As a precaution, our email service provider suspended MURAL’s account. This resulted in MURAL product emails \\(for example: invitations to join a mural\\) not sending.\n\nMURAL worked with our email service provider to restore service as quickly as possible. Together with our service provider we implemented a fix at 02:50 UTC on June 18th, which restored full service and allowed the pending emails to be sent. We continued to monitor the results of the fix until 04:00 UTC, at which time the incident was closed.\n\n‌\n\n**Summary**\n\nMURAL’s platform remained available throughout this incident. There was a delay of 2 hours and 50 minutes sending product emails, but this did not impact service availability.",

At 08:48 UTC we confirmed this was an issue affecting a significant proportion of MURAL users and escalated this to our incident response team to commence investigations.\n\nAt 10:25 UTC our cloud provider confirmed there was an issue with their portal \\(see [https://status.azure.com/en-gb/status/history/](https://status.azure.com/en-gb/status/history/) for more details\\). This was confirmed to be the root cause of the issue affecting MURAL users.\n\nAt 12:16 UTC, in collaboration with our cloud provider, we successfully updated our connection to the Azure portal. By 12:50 UTC full connectivity and service in MURAL had been restored. \n\n‌\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis incident resulted in 5 hours 2 mins of downtime. No data from prior to the outage was lost during this time.",

Authentication requests were being redirected from their customer tenants to the main [app.mural.co](http://app.mural.co) tenant, resulting in their users being unable to log in. Initial reports of this were received from MURAL customers on Sunday May 1st. Further reports were received on Monday May 2nd, at which point the issue was classified as a major incident and our task force was engaged.\n\n‌\n\n**Summary**\n\nMURAL’s task force started investigating at 13:58 UTC on Monday May 2nd. The cause of the issue was identified as being an incorrect configuration in how users on custom tenants were being routed through the login process. Once the issue was identified, a fix was rolled out at 14:07 UTC. This immediately corrected the login flow for clients using BYOK.\n\n‌\n\n‌**What we've done to avoid this happening again**\n\nParts of the login flow for BYOK clients had been hard-coded. We have changed this to be dynamically generated, reducing the risk of code-based errors. We are also researching avenues to improve the automated monitoring of login issues.",

The change proceeded as planned and no immediate issues were detected during our post-release checks.\n\nLater that day our engineers detected unexpected behavior with MURAL search results. An immediate decision was taken to roll back to the previous version. The process to roll back the upgrade was unsuccessful. Our team worked through the weekend to restore search functionality within MURAL workspaces. Public API endpoints for searching were however inoperative.\n\nOur team continued working through the next week to identify the root of the issue with ElasticSearch. On Friday, February 25, the indexes were fully rebuilt on a new ES6 cluster, tested successfully in beta, and then enabled in production. This restored full functionality using ES6, including the public API endpoints for search.\n\n‌\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis incident resulted in a partial outage for search functionality within MURAL workspaces, lasting 54 hours and 56 minutes. MURAL remained operational throughout this incident and members were able to log in and access their data.\n\n‌\n\n**What we've done to avoid this happening again**\n\nWe are re-evaluating our upgrade process for ES6 to ES7 to ensure this does not happen again during the next upgrade.",

During our initial investigations we were unable to reproduce the issue. We continued to receive reports and at 09:40 UTC on November 19 2021 we classified this as a critical incident. The relevant code for displaying icons was retained and no data was lost, however the icons were not being displayed.\n\n‌\n\n**Details and corrective actions**\n\nAt 16:26 UTC we updated the configuration for the Noun Project integration, which restored full service with no data loss.\n\n‌\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis incident resulted in a partial outage for a core service, lasting 7 hours and 44 minutes. MURAL remained operational throughout this incident and members were able to log in and access their data; however, some Noun Project icons were not visible in the search menu or on murals.\n\n‌\n\n**What we've done to avoid this happening again**\n\nWe have resolved the configuration issue and restored full service with the use of icons. We are working on several short- and medium-term initiatives to improve the reliability of this service going forward.",

This in turn overloaded the database and resulted in access requests also failing. Once the original operation finished at 22:42, the database returned to normal operations and access to the MURAL application was restored. \n\n‌\n\n**Details and corrective actions** \n\nThe specifics of how the operation was performed resulted in a less-known bug on our database server to be triggered. We now understand the steps and will update our processes to avoid repeating this scenario.\n\n‌\n\n**Summary** \n\nThe outage resulted in 50 minutes of downtime. No data from prior to the outage was lost during this time. \n\n‌\n\n**What we've done to avoid this happening again** \n\nWe have updated our processes for running database operations to avoid triggering the now-known bug, and will be performing an upgrade to fully mitigate the issue. This upgrade will be announced on the MURAL status page as routine maintenance with the appropriate notice period.",

A very large number of simultaneous operations in a single workspace, specifically joining a workspace and moving content between workspaces, generated write conflicts and resulted in the primary database server locking up. Users that were logged in at the time had their sessions terminated and no new login requests could be processed.\n\n**‌Details and corrective actions**  \nWe identified the cause of the incident and initiated a fail-over to a new primary database server at 06:44 UTC. This was completed at 07:35 UTC, at which point full service was restored. We immediately started investigating the root cause of the write conflicts and optimizing the workflows for joining workspaces to prevent this from impacting system availability again.\n\n‌**Summary**  \nThe outage resulted in 1 hour and 20 minutes of downtime. No data from prior to the outage was lost during this time.\n\n‌**What we’ve done to avoid this happening again**  \nAs an immediate action we implemented an optimization to the workflow for joining the impacted workspace. We are working towards applying this update to all workspaces in an upcoming release.",

A bulk action in billing groups resulted in the primary database server locking up. Users that were logged in at the time had their sessions terminated and no new login requests could be processed.\n\n‌\n\n**Details and corrective actions**\n\nAt 17:32 UTC we initiated a fail-over to a new primary database server. This was completed at 17:46 UTC, at which time full service was restored with no data loss.\n\n‌\n\n**What happened next?**\n\nAt 23:33 UTC we experienced a similar set of events and the database on the new primary database server became unresponsive.\n\n‌\n\n**Details and corrective actions**\n\nAt 23:42 UTC we initiated a fail-over to another new primary database server. This was completed at 23:56 UTC, at which time full service was restored with no data loss.\n\n‌\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe first outage resulted in 16 minutes of downtime, with another 23 minutes of downtime for the second outage.\n\n‌\n\n**What we’ve done to avoid this happening again**\n\nFollowing the outage on May 19, we performed a series of maintenance operations over the weekend of May 22-23 to significantly improve our database performance. This reduced the likelihood of a similar outage in future, whilst not entirely eliminating it.\n\nAs an immediate remedial action, we have temporarily disabled the bulk change functionality in billing groups \\(an Enterprise Network feature\\). This functionality is being refactored and will be re-released as soon as possible. \n\nWe are also conducting a comprehensive review of bulk operations within the MURAL platform to ensure this cannot happen again.",

This procedure involved a high number of concurrent operations, which generated unexpected high load on our main database servers, causing the primary to become unresponsive while processing said operations. This resulted in the MURAL application being unavailable for all users.\n\nDetails and corrective actions: \n\nAt 11:06 Pacific Time we initiated a manual failover to a new primary database server. This was completed at 11:17 Pacific Time and we were able to restore full service, without any loss of data.\n\nWhat we’ve done to avoid this happening again:\n\nWe have temporarily restricted the procedure that triggered this situation, while we review and upgrade how it works. This is aimed also at improving our handling of massive bulk data operations to prevent them from impacting service availability.\n\nMURAL administrators can continue to disable users on an individual or pick-list basis, via the admin interface.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience caused by this incident and thank you for your understanding.",

The list of IP addresses for that customer contained an incorrectly formatted IP range, causing an exception in the code that updates our firewall settings. Our firewall configuration system responded to this exception in the most conservative manner possible, temporarily shutting off all customer access.  \n  \nAt 8:27am Pacific Time on Feb 22, 2021 we corrected the malformed entry and re-applied the IP Allowlisting settings for the customer in question, restoring access to the system.\n\n**What we’ve done to avoid this happening again:**  \nAt 5:14am Pacific Time on Feb 23, 2021 we published an update to our Firewall configuration system. This update provides more granular exception handling and ensures that Firewall updates will apply only to the customer being modified.",
