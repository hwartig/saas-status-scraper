During this time, logged out users could not access files in Preview via public shared folder on web app. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change in our ongoing effort to improve performance and stability.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 5 September 2024 02:33 and 7 September 2024 01:31 PST, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, Box Drive & Box Sync were slow in recognizing that documents had been updated by other users and a new copy was needed. The issue occurred because a new software release introduced unexpected latency in a processing pipeline used in propagating update notifications. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the software update, fixing the problem and redeploying. In addition, we have improved our monitoring processes and implemented new monitors to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nStarting 5 September 2024 02:00 \\(PST\\) a software component was deployed that was not properly configured with enough threads.  As a result, throughput of a processing pipeline started to slow and a queue of requests started to build.  The queue was noticed and the responsible component reverted by 6 Sept 2024 12:00 \\(PST\\), but it took until 7 Sept 2024 01:31 \\(PST\\) for the backlog of requests to clear.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Implement monitors on notification queue size\n* Implement throughput monitors on downstream components\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Box KeySafe. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn Thursday, August 29, 2024, between 1:48am and 3:38am PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some Box KeySafe customers experienced difficulty uploading new content to Box, as well as downloading content. Additionally, some customers encountered issues with Microsoft office co-authoring feature. The incident began due to a network connectivity issue within our cloud vendor that impacted Identity and Access Management \\(IAM\\) and access to Key Management Service \\(KMS\\). This caused a backup in requests to some of the Box services involved with Microsoft Co-Authoring. We were able to resolve the issue once normal operation with our cloud vendor was restored. In addition to implementing the recommended customer actions from the vendor-provided RCA, we're also working to enhance the resiliency of our system in related areas and improve visibility through health checks to detect and prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nA cloud vendor network incident disrupted Box's communication with Key Management Service \\(KMS\\) instances, affecting upload and download operations for KeySafe customers. This triggered a cascading effect, as requests accumulated on a backend service involved in Microsoft Office co-authoring. The increased workload on this service's Istio-proxy container led to memory and CPU spikes, causing DNS resolution errors and latency issues. These problems further hampered Microsoft Office co-authoring requests, creating a cycle of retries and failures.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Using regional STS endpoints as recommended by our cloud vendor’s RCA of this issue.\n* Implementing additional health checks for the impacted backend service.\n* Enhancing connection handling of the impacted backed service to prevent excessive queueing.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween July 21, 2024, 3:00 PM PT and July 22, 2024, 2:00 AM PT, some users may have observed that some Relay workflows were delayed. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nRelay workflows are executed on a shared pool of compute resources. This issue occurred because the system was under unusually high load, which delayed the execution of some workflows. We were able to resolve the issue by rebalancing resources across outstanding workflows.\n\nWe are currently enhancing our monitoring and notification systems to ensure that engineers receive timely alerts about resource allocation issues. Additionally, we are focusing on improving our tools for rebalancing resources in order to proactively prevent similar issues from happening again in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Automatic recognition of workflow causing peak load and optimizing resource utilization.\n* Reducing time to action by improving engineering troubleshooting steps to diagnose and detect resource allocation issues that cause delays.\n* Improve internal tooling to allow quicker intervention for on-support specialists.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 2:15 PM and 2:30 PM PDT on June 25, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box Notes. During this time, users would have seen an error banner indicating that the system was reconnecting and, upon reconnecting, some of the users’ recent edits may have been reverted. The issue occurred as a result of a code change enabling values to be written to cache on the Notes servers unintentionally. We were able to resolve the issue by disabling the code that the change was applied to and updating it to no longer write to cache. In addition, we are working to improve the resiliency of our system in the related areas as well as gain higher visibility through logging to detect and prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred because a process that reads values from the Notes database and caches them in memory on the Notes server was unintentionally enabled on servers not taking live traffic \\(passive\\). Meanwhile, servers taking live traffic \\(active\\) were allowed to make updates to those values in the Notes database. However, the values in cache on the passive servers were not updated or cleared. When traffic was redirected to the passive servers, those stale values were returned from cache causing a mismatch in what was returned by the server and what was expected by clients. Clients attempted to send updates to the servers to correct the mismatch, but a bug in the client caused the updates to be invalid and rejected by the servers. This resulted in an error banner being shown and the client being unable to recover from the mismatch.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Update code to prevent process from running on passive servers\n* Update code to clear values from cache when servers transition from passive to active\n* Fix client bug causing invalid updates to be sent to server\n* Add logging to detect when values are returned from cache unintentionally\n* Improve developer documentation to prevent similar changes from being made in the future\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.\n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 12:13 AM and 2:55 AM PDT on June 14, 2024 and between 8:04 AM and 10:44 AM PDT on June 17, 2024, some users may have experienced slow or failed Search queries while working in Box. The issue occurred due to a change in a query pattern coming into the system that caused increased load on the search backend. We were able to resolve the issue by adding additional capacity to the search backends. In addition, we are working on updating our resource allocation to prevent load on a few search backend nodes from affecting other nodes.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOn June 14, some search nodes received a change in a query pattern that caused high load. This led to increased query latency and query failures, which eventually impacted users of Search. We were able to add more query nodes to handle the higher load. On June 17, the query pattern re-occurred with increased volume. In the second occurrence, we were able to again address the increased volume with additional capacity. We are reconfiguring resource allocation in the search backend nodes to better handle changes to query patterns. In addition, we’re working on solutions to prevent added load on a few nodes from cascading.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Increase resources/right size clusters\n* Optimize resource utilization to better handle the new query pattern\n* Isolate search nodes to ensure better quality of service to all users\n* Decrease the amount of time it takes to add new resources\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "_We recently addressed issues affecting Search. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future._\n\n \n\n_Between 9:33 pm PDT on June 3, 2024 and 1:28 pm PDT on June 4, 2024 and between 6:38 pm PDT and 7:52 pm PDT on June 6, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users were intermittently unable to query Search or receive Search results. This issue impacted a very small number \\(approximately 2%\\) of enterprises. During the first period, the issue occurred as a result of a partially rolled out recent code change. This code change was part of our ongoing effort to improve performance and stability. During the second period, the issue occurred a result of a latent bug in the Search Shadow service, which was used to investigate the root cause of the initial issue. We were able to resolve the issue by fully rolling back the change in both cases. In addition, we have added alerting to detect partial rollouts of changes as well as tests in pre-production environments and addressed the latent bug in the Search Shadow service to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future._ \n\n‌\n\n_Analysis_ \n\n_On June 3, 2024, Search released a change to how backend Search nodes are queried in order to improve performance and stability. This change had an unintended effect on query patterns that dramatically increased load for a small number of queries and only manifested at scale. Although the number of such queries was small, when a backend Search node processed them it would sporadically run out of memory and impact all traffic to that particular node. The Search release mechanism partially rolled out this change to a fraction of the fleet, but did not progress further. We initiated standard rollback procedures, but we did not detect that the change remained deployed on one of the nodes. This complicated the processes of diagnosing and mitigating the impact. The issue was mitigated when the partial rollback was detected and the change was fully rolled back._\n\n‌\n\n_On June 6, 2024, as part of the investigation to identify and verify the root cause of the initial issue, the Search team utilized a so-called Shadow service in production that does not service live traffic.  However, this Shadow service contained a latent bug that allowed a small percent of queries to be issued against the live backend Search nodes. Because the issue that occurred on June 3, 2024 could be triggered with just a handful of queries, the live serving nodes were inadvertently impacted by this Shadow service. The Shadow service change was rolled back to mitigate._\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n_Corrective Actions_\n\n_The following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:_\n\n* _Improve release mechanisms and procedures to fully rollout or rollback changes in a bounded period of time_\n* _Add tooling and alerting to determine whether a change is fully or only partially deployed_\n* _Add additional tests to pre-production environments to detect unintended Search query pattern changes that sporadically increase load on backend Search nodes_\n* _Fix latent bug in Shadow service and add additional monitoring to detect queries being routed incorrectly to live backend Search nodes_\n\n‌\n\n_We are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter._ \n\n \n\n_Sincerely,_\n\n_The Box Team_",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the current state and we may update as more information is confirmed._ \n\n \n\nOn May 29, 2024, between 1:39 am and 6:40 am PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. Over the course of this period, there were several 60-90 second time intervals when logins and various other functionality was impaired. This issue occurred due to a recent change in our token rotation process as part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the security of our systems. We resolved the problem by overriding the process and updating the expired tokens.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 10:00 PM PST and 10:23 PM PST on April 24, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some Box customers might have experienced elevated error rate or increased latency with Box API requests. The issue occurred due to an unexpected failure during a MySQL Instance failover that was executed in response to high load on one of the database instances. We were able to resolve the issue by manually executing the instance failover. In addition, we have implemented a new discovery mechanism that improves the time to detect and propagate a MySQL topology change to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nDuring the incident, a failover was executed for a MySQL leader that had high CPU usage. The failover process failed to propagate the topology change and caused the impact to Box API success rate. The issue was remediated by executing the rest of the failover steps manually and the impact recovered once the new topology was successfully propagated to other components. The root cause of high CPU usage was later determined to be organic increase in week over week traffic and the impacted instance was upsized to add more CPU cores.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* The Database instance that had high CPU Usage was scaled up to add more CPU cores\n* Additionally, we are looking into remapping the Database instances to normalize the load on the impacted instance.\n* A MySQL Topology Discovery mechanism that significantly improves time to detect and propagate topology updates has been rolled out. This new mechanism improves mean time to recovery \\(MTTR\\) for similar issues in the future.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 5:35 PM and 7:20 PM PDT, on April 22, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users may have experienced degradation of Public API, Login, Box Sign, Authorization, Uploads, Downloads, Notes, and Box for Office integrations.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred as a result of the temporarily reduced capacity in the impacted region by an infrastructure change intended to create additional dedicated infrastructure for one of our databases in a different region. We were able to resolve the issue by shifting workload and adding capacity in the impacted region. In addition, we have reduced the complexity of infrastructure changes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Streamlining processes regarding these types of changes to remove extraneous complexity and reduce the likelihood of unintended impact.\n* Establishing additional guardrails to minimize the likelihood of unintended inclusion of disruptive changes.\n* Improving processes to deal with managing the complexity and discovery of undesired operations associated with these changes. \n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 6:04 PM and 6:14 PM PST on April 14, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties with Box Public APIs. During this time, some public API requests failed and there may have been a brief increase in latency. The issue occurred due to an unexpected spike in authentication requests and resolved as the traffic returned to normal. We are working on improvements to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis**\n\n‌\n\nAn unexpected spike in traffic to one of our authentication databases coupled with an inefficient query in our application caused a brief delay in data replication. The replication recovered automatically, resolving the impact. Our team has investigated this issue and will be making changes to optimize the inefficient query.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Optimize database query by adding index\n* Avoid retrieving unnecessary metadata as part of authentication to improve performance and resilience\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "Between 3:11 AM PT and 5:33 AM PT on April 11, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users might have not been able to access Box Notes. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change in our ongoing effort to improve user experience and stability of our application. We were able to resolve the issue by releasing a missing configuration value in production. In addition, we are working to improve our safety and efficiency of our release process to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\n‌\n\nThe code change responsible for the issue in object was caused by a missing configuration value in production settings. As a result, all instances of Notes using the new version image were unable to open and experienced downtime.\n\n‌\n\nDuring this incident, we identified certain gaps that contributed to this issue or resulted in longer-than-normal remediation, all of which we are working to address. First, this issue exposed a gap in our validation process for production configurations either before deployment or during server startup. Additionally, this issue did not trigger any alerts and was not visible through tracked metrics like SLO and UA graphs, which resulted in a lack of visibility of this issue. Finally, the deployment process for Notes servers does not allow for immediate rollbacks due to statefulset rollout taking approximately 45 minutes to complete, and our current incremental deployment process leaves us without a fully safe data center option as fallback.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Implementing production setting configuration safety improvements to reduce the likelihood of similar issues occurring again in the future.\n* Creating alerts on client-side JS errors to improve alerting and visibility of such issues.\n* Improving Notes incremental release safety to improve our deployment processes and facilitate more effective remediation of issues with deployments.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 2:41 AM and 2:51 PM PDT on March 26, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box Sign. During this time, the users were unable to send manual reminders for pending Sign requests, and delete sign requests in the WebApp. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred as a result of a recent code change made to improve Box Sign functionality. The issue presented itself in the sign mechanism for request handling, resulting in the sign reminder and delete functionalities not being available to the users. Incomplete automated testing coverage and pre-release checks for the functionalities mentioned above allowed the issue to go undetected before production deployment. We were able to quickly resolve the issue by performing a rollback of the sign web service. In addition, we are working on improving our monitoring system, pre-release quality check procedures, engineering on-call documentation and the robustness of the sign request handling mechanism to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Enhancing monitoring and alerts graphs in the sign service\n* Increasing the integration test coverage of the area affected in the incident \\(and adjacent ones\\)\n* Updating the sign engineering on-call documentation, as part of the effort to facilitate the improvement of detection and resolution time\n* Improving the robustness of the sign request handling mechanism\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 1:00PM PT and 1:40PM PT on March 7, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users were not able to access files stored in Box folders. The issue occurred as a result of a deployment of a data access service in our ongoing effort to improve the scalability of Box’s infrastructure. While deploying this service, a central control plane component became overloaded and was unable to propagate new data access instance information to the applications. We were able to resolve the issue by scaling up the control plane component. In addition, we are working to over-provision the control plane component and improve the monitoring and alerting to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nBox utilizes a communication layer called \"Service Mesh\" to facilitate effective communication between its services. However, a recent increase in the number of applications onboarded to Service Mesh caused the control plane component to become overloaded, resulting in delays propagating instance changes for impacted services. Before the incident occurred, several core applications underwent deployment simultaneously, including the Data Access Service. Unfortunately, the control plane failed to promptly propagate instance changes for this service. Since most user interactions with Box rely on connecting with the Data Access Service, users were unable to access files stored in Box folders during this time due to the propagation delay.\n\n‌\n\nTo address this issue and prevent future occurrences of control plane overload, we have scaled up its capacity by three times and implemented improved monitoring and alerting mechanisms.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Scaling up control plane capacity to prevent future overload issues. \n* Enhancing monitoring and alerting for the control plane status. \n* Conduct benchmark and scalability testing of the control plane in Pre-Prod environment. \n* Arrange detailed sessions with our technology vendor to optimize Box's Service Mesh infrastructure.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 4:00 PM PST on February 18, 2024 and 9:10 PM PST on February 19, 2024, updates to file and folder counts displayed in Box were delayed for some customers. The issue occurred as a result of an intentional workload migration to mitigate a partial outage in one region of one of our cloud providers.  We were able to resolve the issue by adding resources to the target region to reduce the cross-region latency impact. These delays only affected the visibility of file and folder counts; the counts themselves were maintained.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOn February 16th, a resource migration from one of our regions to another was performed as a mitigation effort for an unrelated issue. An increase in traffic on February 18th combined with the region shift resulted in a backlog in the file and folder counts workflow.\n\nWe addressed the issue by adding more resources to the new region. We are currently in the process of further consolidating the resources for this workflow to avoid significant delays and backlogs. Furthermore, to minimize the likelihood of similar situations occurring again, we are implementing checks and alerts to prevent future scenarios in which resource shortages could lead to delays in updating file and folder counts.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* We will implement checks and alerts to trigger if the workflow processing slows down and starts to back up.\n* We will add further documentation to our run book as references to be used in the event of similar region outages, ensuring that our service remains resilient to such incidents.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 03:37 PM and 03:47 PM PST on January 22, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, an internal service was restarted, which resulted in some users experiencing degraded performance and/or intermittent errors on Box Uploads, Downloads and Public API. The issue occurred as a result of a previous infrastructure change and was automatically resolved once the impacted service successfully restarted and stabilized. We are enhancing our deployment automation and defining additional processes to minimize the risk of similar issues occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOn January 22, 2024, a change was rolled out on an availability zone in one of our primary regions in which an internal database interaction service was running. There was a pre-existing discrepancy between the code and infrastructure originating from a previous operation performed in response to an unrelated incident. This discrepancy resulted in the impacted service restarting, which caused some users to experience degraded performance. \n\nWhen the change went live, the availability of the service dropped. That caused traffic from downstream services that directed to the service fleet in this zone to fail. As a result the top level metrics were impacted for 10 minutes. The impacted service came back up shortly after, which remediated the issue.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Enhancing automation to prevent disruptive changes from going live\n* Putting processes and internal SLAs in place that will eliminate discrepancies between our code and infrastructure\n* Adding measures in our codebase to reduce the chances of causing disruptions  \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "_We recently addressed issues affecting the Office Online integration. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future._\n\nBetween 02:48 AM and 04:06AM PT on January 18, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, Box customers were unable to open or edit Microsoft Office files via Office Online. The issue occurred as a result of network connectivity issues. We were able to resolve the issue by restoring the network connectivity. In addition, we are working to make the Office Online integration more resilient to such failures, to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\nAnalysis \n\nThe Office Online integration communicates with Microsoft servers in order to provide Office for the Web capabilities for files hosted in Box. This communication happens via the Web Application Open Platform Interface \\(WOPI\\) protocol.\n\nBox performs signature validation of each WOPI command it receives. The cryptographic keys needed to perform this validation are acquired through a process called WOPI discovery. During the discovery process, Box fetches an XML file from the Microsoft servers. This file contains the keys needed to perform signature validation. The file is then cached for a period of time.\n\nPrior to the outage, the discovery endpoint for one of the Office Online environments became briefly unreachable. At the same time, the cache on the Box side expired. Box then failed to refetch the discovery XML for one of the environments, which caused the signature validation to fail in a cascading way across all other environments.\n\n‌\n\nCorrective Actions\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* The cache time-to-live for the discovery file will be increased, to reduce Box’s exposure to any failures to reach the discovery endpoint\n* Changes will be made to ensure that failures to acquire discovery information for one Office Online environment do not impact other environments\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn January 9, 2024, between 11:10 AM PT and 12:15 PM PT, users experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users experienced slowness and failures interacting with most parts of the Box webapp and public API, including Logins, Uploads and Downloads. The issue was triggered by a change that impacted Kubernetes clusters in one of the regions where we run our critical services. At 11:18 AM PT this change was rolled back. After rolling back the change, systems began to recover around 11:27 AM. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOn January 9th, 2024, we made a configuration change to deploy a new daemonset to the dedicated Kubernetes clusters running our core data services, which caused resource exhaustion and eviction of our core data services on those nodes. The daemonset deployment pipeline erroneously allowed the change to be promoted to an entire region instead of the planned gradual rollout, which resulted in service interruption impacting most of our customers. To address this issue, we rolled back the daemonset deployment. After the daemonset was rolled back, the evicted core data services began to be restored and our systems began to recover; however, in two of our three clusters, this process was delayed by a scheduler limitation, elongating the duration of impact. We adjusted the resource requests for our core data services to speed up recovery of these two clusters, restoring normal operations at 12:15pm.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* We have paused the daemonset pipeline until we can ensure it employs safe incremental rollout processes.\n* We are updating the daemonset pipeline to validate resource allocations before deployment and ensure a gradual production rollout to reduce the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future.\n* We have adjusted the priority of our application services, including the core data services, to be higher than daemonsets to ensure their capacity is protected.\n* We are adjusting our Kubernetes configurations to enable faster restoration of service through guaranteed capacity and buffers.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.\n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "## Background\n\nOn December 15, 2023 Box experienced a severe service degradation. During this time, users experienced slowness and failures interacting with all parts of the Box webapp and public API; including Logins, Uploads and Downloads. Additionally, some customers might have seen small subsets of their content created during the incident become sporadically hidden. \n\n‌\n\nThe issue was triggered by a partial power loss that impacted persistent disks in one of the cloud infrastructure availability zones in which we operate, leading to multiple active databases being impacted. Although our database infrastructure is architected with zonal redundancy, the unique nature of the failure surfaced a gap in our zonal health monitoring and presented unforeseen challenges for our automatic recovery tooling, extending the resolution time. We were ultimately able to resolve the issue by manually shifting traffic out of the impacted availability zone. \n\n## Analysis\n\nBox’s database infrastructure is designed to be able to withstand problems impacting a single availability zone. Our database replicas are spread across multiple availability zones for redundancy and we have automated tooling in place that can detect faults and shift traffic to other replicas should that become necessary. Both the redundant replicas and automated tooling are exercised regularly as part of our normal operations.\n\n‌\n\nIn this case, when the partial power loss took place, it impacted several of our databases in a way that compromised their ability to serve high traffic volumes. Diagnosing this type of partial zonal failure was challenging due to the high variability of impact across multiple databases. Because of this unique confluence of factors, the root cause proved challenging to diagnose and mitigate both for our automation and incident responders, extending time to resolution. Once we confirmed the impact was limited to a single availability zone, we were able to effectively mitigate all active databases out of the impacted zone by leveraging other availability zones.\n\n‌\n\nDuring the course of our mitigation efforts, replication topologies may have caused certain newly created files or file versions to intermittently not appear in a limited number of Box accounts. These intermittent visibility issues were resolved as replication topologies were normalized and caches were later cleared. \n\n## Next Steps and Corrective Actions\n\nWe are continuing to conduct a comprehensive engineering postmortem.  Therefore, this report is subject to change based on our further analysis and findings.\n\n‌\n\nThe following corrective actions have been, or continue to be, implemented:\n\n* improve our ability to diagnose partial availability zone degradations like the one we encountered in this incident;\n* improve our automatic incident mitigation system to better handle partial zone degradations;\n* improve our testing strategies for the database tier mitigation systems to cover this type of failure scenario; and\n* conduct a comprehensive audit of our production systems to validate their resilience to zonal failures and degradations.\n\n‌\n\nThe above noted corrective actions will strengthen our efforts to safeguard against partial zone degradations, reduce mitigation timeframes and support enhanced testing and prevention efforts.  \n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "## Background\n\nWe recently addressed issues affecting Box Webapp, Public and Uploads & Downloads. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future. \n\nBetween 4:30 AM PST and 5:05 AM PST on December 15, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During these times, some users may have experienced slowness and failures interacting  with parts of the Box Webapp and public API, including Uploads and Downloads. The issue occurred due to an issue with the deployment of a new DB Access Control service on our database fleet.  We were able to resolve the issue by temporarily disabling the problematic service. In addition, we are working to improve our testing and rollout process for services being deployed to our database fleet to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe DB Access Control service is a service that enables new user access controls to be applied automatically and frequently.  This allows for faster development of new DB functionality that requires access control changes, resulting in faster team velocity and ultimately more stable and reliable infrastructure.  \n\nOn the morning of December 13th, an operator started the rollout of the DB Access Control service by deploying it to a single database pod. At that time, it was configured to execute its work every 10 minutes.  Approximately 10 minutes after the deployment, we saw degradation on that pod, causing the impact seen on December 13. The operator suspected that the service frequency was the cause and remediated by configuring the service to execute its work once a day at a low-traffic time. The next steps should have been to validate the changes in a way that would not result in customer impact and then deploy it again on a single pod. However, the standard process was unintentionally not adhered to in this case and the change was instead deployed across the fleet, leading to additional impact as seen on December 15.\n\nIn addition to optimizing the DB Access Control service to be less resource-intensive, we intend to make some process changes in response to this issue. There is already a general standard process that should be followed when deploying services to the Database fleet. However, to minimize the likelihood of similar situations occurring again, we are updating our documentation to better ensure that all operators have a comprehensive understanding of the standard process and that such process is consistently followed. \n\n## Next Steps and Corrective Actions\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* The relevant DB service was temporarily disabled to remediate the issue.\n* The relevant DB service has been optimized to be less resource-intensive and will automatically refuse to run during high-traffic times\n* Rollout process for all DB services will be more thoroughly documented\n* Operators will receive additional training to ensure that they have a comprehensive understanding of the documented rollout process\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future. \n\n‌\n\nBetween 10:28 AM PST and 10:38 AM PST on December 13, 2023 and between 4:30 AM PST and 5:05 AM PST on December 15, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During these times, some users may have experienced slowness and failures interacting  with parts of the Box Webapp and public API, including Uploads and Downloads. The issue occurred due to an issue with the deployment of a new DB Access Control service on our database fleet.  We were able to resolve the issue by temporarily disabling the problematic service. In addition, we are working to improve our testing and rollout process for services being deployed to our database fleet to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe DB Access Control service is a service that enables new user access controls to be applied automatically and frequently.  This allows for faster development of new DB functionality that requires access control changes, resulting in faster team velocity and ultimately more stable and reliable infrastructure.  \n\n‌\n\nOn the morning of December 13th, an operator started the rollout of the DB Access Control service by deploying it to a single database pod. At that time, it was configured to execute its work every 10 minutes.  Approximately 10 minutes after the deployment, we saw degradation on that pod, causing the impact seen on December 13. The operator suspected that the service frequency was the cause and remediated by configuring the service to execute its work once a day at a low-traffic time. The next steps should have been to validate the changes in a way that would not result in customer impact and then deploy it again on a single pod. However, the standard process was unintentionally not adhered to in this case and the change was instead deployed across the fleet, leading to additional impact as seen on December 15.\n\n‌\n\nIn addition to optimizing the DB Access Control service to be less resource-intensive, we intend to make some process changes in response to this issue. There is already a general standard process that should be followed when deploying services to the Database fleet. However, to minimize the likelihood of similar situations occurring again, we are updating our documentation to better ensure that all operators have a comprehensive understanding of the standard process and that such process is consistently followed. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* The relevant DB service was temporarily disabled to remediate the issue.\n* The relevant DB service has been optimized to be less resource-intensive and will automatically refuse to run during high-traffic times\n* Rollout process for all DB services will be more thoroughly documented\n* Operators will receive additional training to ensure that they have a comprehensive understanding of the documented rollout process\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed an issue affecting multi-factor authentication logins. We would like to further explain the issue and action items we had taken to prevent it from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 9:00 AM PST and 12:30 PM PST on November 6, 2023, some users experienced latency and difficulty logging into Box. During this time, users logging in to Box with multi-factor authentication may have encountered slow responses or failures during the login process. Upon investigation, we determined that the cause of this issue was the result of a single enterprise repeatedly retrying programmatic session termination calls for all its users, which temporarily overburdened the multi-factor authentication service. The issue was resolved when the user was temporarily prevented from using the session termination API.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe issue occurred due a confluence of factors relating to our session termination API and multi-factor authentication service. Specifically, at the time of this issue, our session termination API did not have a rate limiter in place, which allowed a customer to repeatedly call the API with an excessive number of requests to the multi-factor authentication service. The multi-factor-authentication service additionally did not rate-limit the specific call made to it by the session termination API. Finally, the internal retry logic for timed-out requests continued to load the multi-factor authentication service. As a result, due to the unusually high session termination calls, our multi-factor authentication service became overburdened and resulted in the temporary impact to users.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Adding rate limits to the session termination API and the multi-factor authentication service.\n* Enhancing dashboard and alerts related to session termination API and multi-factor authentication.\n* Optimization of the logic between the session termination API and multi-factor authentication service to improve throughput.\n* Investigation of retry logic to prevent perpetuating overload situations.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 2:32 pm and 4:05 pm PST on November 3, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, file-related notifications were temporarily delayed. The issue occurred due to an expired authentication token used in one of our environments. We were able to resolve the issue by rotating the token, at which point entire backlog of unsent notifications was sent. In addition, we are working on putting additional safeguards in place to alert us beforehand in such cases earlier to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue was caused by an expired token used to distribute software within Box infrastructure. As a result, there was temporary inability for the affected mechanism to distribute the current version of software. This has led to a number of jobs triggering continuously to pause, since these could not obtain the current version of software due to this issue. One of these jobs that was impacted was batching job for notifications, and this caused the temporary impact to end users. Due to a limitation in alerting mechanism in this area, the alert did not fire as expected as a warning beforehand. \n\n‌\n\nWe were able to resolve this issue by rotating the token, which restored the impacted functionality. Once the problem was mitigated, the notification job started firing again and quickly sent out the historical backlog of unsent notifications. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improve the token renewal alerting automation to detect and fire alerts for any expiring tokens\n* Improve the token distribution and renewal process to ensure our core infrastructure services always have valid authentication tokens\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, users were unable to find some documents that were uploaded, modified or moved during the specified period. The issue occurred as a result of changes to our infrastructure to more uniformly distribute the index across all shards in our search clusters. Specifically, a new sharding scheme was applied to our live serving search clusters resulting in some recently updated documents going to the the wrong shards. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting back to the old sharding scheme for live clusters. In addition, we are working on adding mechanisms to safely alter sharding scheme for live production clusters to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue occurred due to alteration of the sharding scheme used for indexing to live serving search clusters. This change inadvertently resulted in inconsistency between the sharding scheme used to update documents and the sharding scheme used to query the cluster. As a result, a small portion of documents that were created, updated or moved on Box during the issue time window were indexed to a different shard than what the user queries were being processed on. Since the sharding scheme only impacted a small portion of content on Box \\(less than 1%\\), most documents were still searchable, and this issue only impacted a relatively small number of files.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Adding checks in the system to ensure indexing and query pipeline are using the same sharding scheme for a specific cluster\n* Adding tooling to identify if document is being indexed to the wrong shard on a cluster\n* Update procedure for changing sharding scheme to prevent unintentionally applying it to all serving clusters.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Uploads, Web Logins, Downloads, Sign, and Public API. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 10:11AM  and 10:32AM PDT on October 6, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may not have been able to log in, upload/download content, or interact with some components of Sign or some API endpoints. The issue occurred as the result of a configuration change affecting internal routing and DNS infrastructure. We were able to resolve the issue by restoring the original configuration. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue was caused by a configuration change intended to shift traffic between our cloud provider and on-premise infrastructure to a redundant path on the network. This configuration change inadvertently impacted our internal routing and DNS infrastructure, which certain Box services rely on for internal name resolution during network maintenance. The inability for services to resolve internal resources lead to a cascading effect of errors across several services.  After reviewing the incident it was discovered that the redundant path was missing the key route for our DNS infrastructure.  As such, part of the network path between the public cloud and on-premise datacenter were temporarily disrupted. \n\n‌\n\nAs part of Box’s migration to public cloud, our traditional datacenter network was connected to our public cloud vendor with multiple high-bandwidth connections.  As Box has completed its service migration to the public cloud, we are working to reduce the number of these connections being used.  In connection with this effort, we migrated traffic off of two links that were serving as a connection between the cloud and our DNS infrastructure.  Due to a missing configuration, the DNS-specific route was not being propagated throughout the network as expected; as a result, when these two links were turned off, our cloud infrastructure temporarily lost access to our DNS infrastructure.  This caused our internal services to stop being able to perform DNS lookups between each other.  At 10:32AM PDT, these links were turned back on, which allowed us to restore the original configuration and remediate this issue. However, because our configuration pipelines were also impacted by this issue and unable to connect to our DNS infrastructure, these links had to be turned back on manually, which impacted our time to remediation.\n\n‌\n\nBox has been migrating to a public cloud platform over the course of 2022-2023 to improve overall performance and reliability. Our DNS infrastructure is one of the final components that will be migrated to be hosted in public cloud. This migration is expected to be completed in the coming quarter and will give our public cloud infrastructure the ability to have this DNS locally instead of relying on these connections.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improve change procedure for routing changes involving interim hybrid connectivity critical infrastructure.  This will provide extra oversight over changes of this type to minimize the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future.\n* Finish the migration of DNS infrastructure into public cloud.\n* Improve resilience of our configuration pipelines so that impact to production does not also impact these pipelines. \n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nOn October 2, 2023, between 09:50 am PDT and 10:27 am PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have had a degraded experience or difficulty accessing Public API, Downloads, Uploads, Login, and Sign. The issue occurred due to a change to one of our backend systems that created a bottleneck that impacted other internal services. We were able to resolve the issue by deploying more instances of the service experiencing the bottleneck. In addition, we are implementing improvements for enhanced control over the flow of traffic within our backend systems. We are also working to establish new alerts on the impacted processes that will decrease time to detect and mitigate similar issues if they occur in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nBox services are underpinned by a common service communication layer called “Service Mesh” providing Box’s services with the abilities to securely communicate and automatically adapt the scale of the services to traffic bursts. During this incident we observed that the Service Mesh layer did not behave as expected. Specifically, the impacted service did not auto-scale as planned and, as a result, the service became overwhelmed leading to the issue. A deeper analysis of the issue demonstrated that the existing Service Mesh configuration, while optimum for the on-premise deployments, was not optimized for the traffic profile experienced in the public cloud.\n\n‌\n\nWe have been working with the technology vendor for our Service Mesh implementation to tune the configuration according to the new environment and have been rolling out the changes incrementally. We have also increased the capacity on critical services while rolling out these changes to minimize reliance on auto-scaling during that period.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Configure limits for the number of retries within internal systems to improve performance during peak traffic times.\n* Implement additional back pressure “circuit breakers” within our backend systems to protect the system from overloading in the event that similar conditions occur in the future.\n* Improve error handling to better differentiate Service Mesh errors from application errors.\n* Improve monitoring measures to automatically detect, diagnose, and remediate such issues before customers are actually impacted.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 12:40 am PDT, on September 28, 2023, and 03:20 am PDT, on September 28, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have had a degraded experience or difficulty accessing Public API, Downloads, Uploads, Login, and Sign. The issue occurred due to an observed latency in one of our internal services responsible for providing security recommendations to the application.  We were able to resolve the issue by deploying more instances of the impacted service. In addition, we are implementing improvements for enhanced control over the flow of traffic within our backend systems. We are also working to establish new alerts on the impacted processes that will decrease time to detect and mitigate if a similar issue take place in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nBox services are underpinned by a common service communication layer called “Service Mesh” providing Box’s services with the abilities to securely communicate and automatically adapt the scale of the services to traffic bursts. During this incident we observed that the Service Mesh layer did not behave as expected. Specifically, the service did not auto-scale as planned and as a result, the service became overwhelmed leading to the issue. A deeper analysis of the issue demonstrated that the “Service Mesh” configuration, while optimum for the on-premise deployments, was no longer adapted to the traffic profile experienced in the public cloud.\n\n‌\n\nWe have been working with the technology vendor for our Service Mesh implementation to tune the configuration according to the new environment and have been rolling out the changes incrementally. We have also increased the capacity on the critical services while rolling out the changes to not rely on auto-scaling during that period.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Configure limits for the number of retries within internal systems to improve performance during peak traffic times.\n* Implement additional back pressure “circuit breakers” within our backend systems to protect the system from overloading in case of similar issues.\n* Improve error handling to better differentiate Service Mesh errors from application errors.\n* Improve monitoring measures to automatically detect, diagnose, and remediate such issues before customers are actually impacted.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 10:07am PDT and 10:33am PDT on September 22nd, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, the Box marketing site \\([www.box.com](http://www.box.com)\\) was inaccessible and users attempting to access the site encountered a 404 error page. The issue occurred as a result of instability in Box’s marketing site vendor’s network. We were able to resolve the issue by working with the vendor to deploy a temporary workaround to remediate this issue**.** In addition, we are working with the vendor to improve their rollout verification process and also to identify Box-owned processes to remediate similar issues should they arise in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe cause of this issue was a change in the leader election process of a key component in the vendor’s configuration management pipeline. This change triggered a race condition in a downstream component in the pipeline, which resulted in overwriting some customer configurations with an empty configuration. While the change was rolled out gradually with a canary process, the vendor’s automated rollout verification mechanism was not able to identify the issue. The issue was eventually detected by the vendor’s data plane monitoring systems, which alerted due to the rise in errors being served.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned by the vendor and Box:\n\n* Vendor: Identify and resolve the underlying race condition in configuration lifecycle that resulted in the unintended modifications.\n* Vendor: Improve tooling and processes to more quickly and safely rollback components in the configuration management system.\n* Vendor: Improve internal monitoring and visualization to better assess and understand source of error response alerting to expedite detection and remediation.\n* Box: Identify and implement Box-owned solution to remediate similar issues should they arise in the future.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nOn Monday, Sept 18, 2023, between 07:26 AM PST and 07:33 AM PST, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have encountered errors while loading Box Notes documents. The issue occurred due to a slow leadership election in a coordination service. The issue resolved itself, due to health automation processes recreating the unhealthy service. In addition, we plan to adjust our health check automation to resolve similar issues more quickly should they occur again in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nBox Notes leverages multiple Apache Zookeeper ensembles to coordinate distributed compute services. Each ensemble is composed of a leader and several followers. When a leader fails, the remaining members quickly elect a new leader, who ensures that the other followers’ data is up to date, and continue running without issue, a process that usually takes less than a second and causes no impact.\n\nIn this incident, the leader failed, but the election of a new leader took an unusually long period of time, due to an unexpectedly large amount of data that needed to be synchronized. Due to the amount of time this election took, our health checks triggered an automated process that rebuilds unhealthy ensemble members, which disrupted the election process and further impacted the time taken for the election. Upon investigation, we determined that our health checks should have waited longer before deciding that corrective action was required.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Tune our health checks to be less aggressive in deciding when a resource needs to be recreated.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting the execution of Relay workflows. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 12:00 am PDT on September 13, 2023 and 4:46 pm PDT on September 14, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, scheduled workflows created in Relay were not executing and non-scheduled workflows were executing with delays. The issue occurred as a result of code change introduced earlier this year related to migration of scheduled workflows to new servers. We were able to resolve the issue by fixing the faulty code, which resolved the issue with our internal message queueing system that was responsible for this impact. In addition, we improved logging and observability to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe investigation has shown that the root cause was faulty code, which in specific circumstances, was creating multiple duplicate workflows, rapidly filling internal message queues. This resulted in delays in the execution of non-scheduled workflows and additionally temporarily prevented scheduled workflows from executing correctly. The faulty code was introduced as a performance improvement while doing the migration of scheduled workflows to new servers earlier this year. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Corrected the faulty code responsible for this issue.\n* Introduce more testing of this code to reduce the likelihood of similar issues occurring again in the future.\n* Add alerts and metrics measuring number of scheduled workflow executions and introducing additional logging to facilitate investigation of similar cases in future\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time, customers may have experienced transient failures in the Events API and delays in synchronizing files via Box Drive. The issue occurred because of a sudden surge in customer traffic that overloaded an isolated part of our infrastructure. The issue was resolved once the infrastructure automatically scaled up to handle the load.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred due to our services experiencing a sudden surge in traffic volume from Box Drive. This surge caused the services managing our user events API to run in a degraded state. All these services had automatic scaling enabled, and as they received increased load the services automatically scaled up to accommodate the surge. Due to some limitations in detecting and automatically scaling up new servers, some customer requests experienced failures or delays during this time. The system stabilized once the scale up was complete.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Tune request parameters like timeouts and retry policies across all the services involved.\n* Re-evaluate our auto-scaling configurations to scale up the servers sooner when they receive increased traffic.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",
