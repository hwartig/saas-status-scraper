          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Public API, Downloads, Uploads and Sign. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn July 26, 2023 between 5:30 and 6:20 PM PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have degraded experience or difficulty accessing Public API, Downloads, Uploads and Sign. The issue occurred due to an outage of an internal secrets management system that failed after a rare spike in requests from other systems. We were able to resolve the issue by restarting the front ends of the secrets management system to shed connections. In addition, we scaled up the capacity for the secrets management system as well as modified internal clients to reduce the magnitude of future spikes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe internal secrets management system’s file descriptor and connection limits had been increased two months before this issue occurred. The increases were intended to improve system performance during anomalous conditions, but the system’s TCP ephemeral port range remained too small. A request spike consumed the available ephemeral ports on the hosts, resulting in the system becoming unavailable.  \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Tuned the system’s limits to prevent the port exhaustion condition from reoccurring\n* Improvements made to reduce the recurrence of high magnitude request spikes\n* The connection limiting front end is being replaced with an improved load balancer\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the current state and we may update as more information is confirmed._ \n\n \n\nOn July 20, 2023 between 12:52pm PDT and 1:14pm PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties accessing Box’s marketing sites \\([www.box.com](http://www.box.com) and [box.com](http://box.com)\\). During this time, visitors to Box’s marketing sites were temporarily blocked due to a suspected DDoS attack. The issue occurred as a result of Box’s marketing site vendor mitigating a suspected DDoS attack that also impacted legitimate traffic as well. The issue was resolved once the automated mitigation was turned off. We are working on improving our false-positive detection as well as improving the DDoS mitigation overrides to unblock legitimate traffic to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\nWe are conducting a full engineering postmortem and our overview is subject to change with further analysis and findings. In the event our continuing investigation yields further substantive findings, we may publish additional analysis after the conclusion of the full engineering postmortem.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, customers may have experienced delays when using Notifications, Box Relay/Workflow, Search, Conversion and Uploads. We would like to take this opportunity to provide an analysis of this issue and the corrective actions we have taken in response.\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred due to one of our services experiencing high latency when communicating with a backend cloud database. This caused the service to run in a degraded state. We were able to resolve the issue by adding additional capacity to the service. In addition, we are working on improving performance and reliability of the service to better handle increase in latency when communicating with the backend cloud database. \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Make changes to the service to improve performance and reliability to prevent the service from getting degraded due to high latency when communicating with backend cloud database.\n* Add additional logging to help troubleshoot any future issues between this service and backend cloud database.\n* Update our runbook on how to quickly recover if the service experiences similar issues in the future.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, users may have received an error when creating a new Box Note from a saved template. The issue occurred as a result of a recent infrastructure change that is part of an ongoing effort to improve performance and stability. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the change. In addition, we are working to improve our infrastructure rollout processes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. In addition, we have added additional testing and audited service interactions to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nAs part of Box’s continual process of improvement we are migrating much of our legacy infrastructure to a modern platform. As part of this migration we had updated part of our infrastructure that handles content movement to prepare it for an update to our service discovery framework. This change revealed a divergence in behavior between our current and legacy infrastructure. This divergence prevented the creation of a new Box Note from an existing template in some scenarios.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Full audit of Notes interaction with our content stack services\n* Coordinated testing between Notes and content stack teams to ensure successful behavior in current and legacy environments\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween Monday, July 10th, 2023 at 10:40 AM PDT and Tuesday, July 11th at 3:48 AM PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have experienced intermittent preview errors for documents that had vector-based watermarking enabled. The issue occurred as the result of a recent update that caused a date/time formatting change that was not compatible with our watermarking service. We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back then change and patching the affected service to properly handle the date/time format change. In addition, we are working to improve detection as well as the robustness of handling these types of issues to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nA system package which is responsible for handling internationalization and formatting of strings was updated. The new version of this package included significant whitespace related changes from the The Unicode Common Locale Data Repository \\(CLDR\\) which included change that introduced a Narrow Non-breaking Space \\(Unicode U\\+202F\\) in place of a standard space \\(Unicode U\\+0020\\). This character was not supported in the font that was used by the watermarking service which caused the watermark application to fail in the vector-based watermarking feature.\n\nThis incident revealed some areas for improvement in terms of robustness and testing strategy for this service.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Ensure that we handle all expected unicode characters for date formatting as defined by the The Unicode Common Locale Data Repository \\(CLDR\\)\n* More robust handling of non-supported Unicode characters in general\n* More comprehensive testing to minimize the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 12:10am PDT and 1:02am PDT on July 03, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some Box users may have experienced increased errors or slowness when accessing Box.com, Public API, Box Sign and SSO services. In connection with a planned migration of certain user traffic to a new system, that system’s connection limits were exceeded under high load, which resulted in the system being unavailable for new connections. We were able to resolve the issue by temporarily routing user traffic back to our old system. In addition, we adjusted the configuration of the new system to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe new system we migrated user traffic to the week prior had a connection limit setting unknown to us. Under high load situations, we saw that limit starting to drop new connections, which resulted in errors and slowness for some users. We routed user traffic back to the old system to relieve stress on the new system and to allow us to reconfigure the new system. We have turned off the connection limits on the new system and have been serving out of that new system since.\n\nAdditionally, this issue revealed a gap in our monitoring when requests were being dropped while passing through this layer in our architecture, which contributed to our time to recovery. Additional monitoring to address this gap is being implemented.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Turning off connection limits where such connection limits are not necessary.\n* Actively monitor and test if connections limit are turned back on again in the future.\n* Add distributed tracing to quickly identify where in our stack the problem lies.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n‌\n\nOn June 22, 2023 between 17:05 and 18:02 \\(Pacific Time\\), some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users experienced failures interacting with certain parts of the Box web login, public API and Downloads. The issue occurred as a result of a misconfiguration in a change intended to add new database clusters to accommodate incoming customers. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the change. In addition, we have already implemented process improvements to minimize the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis**\n\nAs part of a routine process, our database team periodically adds new database clusters and makes them available for use via a configuration change. During this incident, as part of the addition of a new database cluster an incorrect command resulted in a misconfiguration that caused some users to experience failures interacting with certain parts of the Box web login, public API and Downloads.  \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Enhance validation process to detect and block this type of misconfiguration before deployment process\n\n* Document and validate change reversal steps ahead of production deployment\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 7:17AM and 7:27AM PDT on June 12, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have experienced degraded performance or difficulty accessing Public API, Downloads, and Uploads. The issue occurred as a result of a cut fiber line on a third-party cloud provider’s network. The issue resolved once the cloud network was able to more evenly distribute traffic to address this issue. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nPrior to the impacted timeframe, one of our third-party cloud providers experienced a cut fiber line. As a result, there was temporary packet loss between two data centers resulting communications issues across Public API, Downloads, Uploads and Web Logins. In response, traffic was subsequently rerouted around the impacted line; however, some Box users may have temporarily experienced degraded performance due to backup links approaching saturation as traffic was rerouted. The impact was resolved as soon as the cloud network was able to appropriately distribute traffic to account for this issue.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Redundancy is already in place to prevent a complete outage. \n* Cloud provider is investigating adding capacity to prevent any future degradation during an event. \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, some users experienced slowness and intermittent failures interacting with certain parts of the Box webapp and public API, including Logins, Uploads and Downloads. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change in our ongoing effort to improve performance and stability. We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back the code change.  We are working to improve our deployment and monitoring processes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nJust prior to the start of the issue, we deployed a change that introduced a new database query in an attempt to simplify complex legacy queries and reduce database load. This new query was more expensive than anticipated, and caused the database to overload on larger tables in the production environment.  Customers may have experienced failed logins, uploads, and downloads as a result.  This change was tested in our pre-production environments for a week prior to release.  However, our pre-production environments have different load characteristics, making it difficult to identify the problem the query would cause under production load.  We are putting additional processes in place to thoroughly validate any database query changes prior to production deployment in order to prevent this from happening again.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Rework the solution to improve expensive database queries.\n* Improve the deployment process to include more incremental stages, streamline the verification process, and expedite rollback speed.\n* Formalize a process that tests DB effectiveness to better assess query impact when we adjust/create them\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting certain parts of the Box Web App and public API, including Logins, Uploads and Downloads. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 11:35 AM PT and 12:42 PM PT on June 1, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users experienced slowness and intermittent failures interacting with certain parts of the Box webapp and public API, including Logins, Uploads and Downloads. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change in our ongoing effort to improve performance and stability. We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back the code change.  We are working to improve our deployment and monitoring processes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nJust prior to the start of the issue, we deployed a change that introduced a new database query in an attempt to simplify complex legacy queries and reduce database load. This new query was more expensive than anticipated, and caused the database to overload on larger tables in the production environment.  Customers may have experienced failed logins, uploads, and downloads as a result.  This change was tested in our pre-production environments for a week prior to release.  However, our pre-production environments have different load characteristics, making it difficult to identify the problem the query would cause under production load.  We are putting additional processes in place to thoroughly validate any database query changes prior to production deployment in order to prevent this from happening again.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Rework the solution to improve expensive database queries.\n* Improve the deployment process to include more incremental stages, streamline the verification process, and expedite rollback speed.\n* Formalize a process that tests DB effectiveness to better assess query impact when we adjust/create them\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time, people using the Box webapp may have experienced increased latency or slowness. The issue occurred because of an erroneous change which constricted the amount of effective hardware capacity for the service dedicated to processing our webapp traffic. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the this change. In addition, we are improving our processes and observability techniques to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis**\n\nOn Friday, May 12, 2023, we deployed a change aimed at improving the processing efficiency of our webapp traffic. Although this change did not result in any observed issues over the weekend, as our traffic increased as APAC and EMEA customers came back to work on Monday morning, it became evident that the change was constricting the effective capacity of the service responsible for processing our webapp traffic. Once this issue was detected, we were able to diagnose the issue and the problematic change was reverted. This ultimately remediated the problem.\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Adjusting our deployment processes to improve monitoring of changes during customer traffic peaks to better detect, diagnose and remediate such issues before customers are actually impacted.\n* The efficiency change that caused the problem has been re-thought and is now implemented in the way that is much less likely to cause any customer impact.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting the Metadata Query API. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 9am and 2pm PT on May 5th, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some requests to the Metadata Query API returned stale or outdated results. The issue occurred due to a delay in the replication of instance create and update events to the query datastore. We were able to resolve the issue by filtering out some events that were causing retries, dead lettering and hence delaying replication. In addition, we have identified the underlying pattern of events that was causing delays in the replication pipeline and patched our replication processing code to handle them gracefully, to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nWhen Metadata instances are mutated using the Box API or one of our applications, events containing the details of these mutations are emitted to a replication stream that is then processed by a pipeline without delay. This ensures the latest state is consistently available to be queried against using the Metadata Query API. We employ multiple optimizations to maintain the near-realtime characteristics of this query functionality, while ensuring all data is replicated consistently.\n\n‌\n\nDuring this incident, one of the optimizations we leverage encountered an unexpected pattern of data, causing it return errors and trigger retries. These retries slowed down processing of the replication stream, causing lag to grow and resulting in queries returning outdated information for some customers. After identifying and filtering out these events causing errors, we were able to get the replication pipeline to once again successfully process events without adding delay. We also increased the rate at which these replication events are processed, in order to recover from the lag that had built up and fully catch up.\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Identified and patched for event pattern that caused errors and hence retries, ensuring graceful handling of unexpected data patterns.\n* Increased batch size for replication stream processing to prevent lag from building up and to enable faster recovery from any backlogs in the future.\n* Improved observability and increased sensitivity of alerts, to ensure faster detection of errors and/or lag build up.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 11:15 pm PT on April 25, 2023 and 8:40 am PT on April 26, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, one of our cloud partners experienced an infrastructure malfunction that impacted one of their European regions. This impact caused the region to exhibit elevated error rates and increased request latency which caused upload and download requests in Box to backup. We were able to resolve this issue by updating storage policies in this European region to use a different but still compliant region. In addition we have taken on a number of near term and longer term remediations to to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.   \n  \n**Analysis**   \nStarting at approximately 7:00 pm PT on April 25, 2023 one of our European partners experienced an infrastructure problem in one availability zone of their France region. At 11:15 pm PT this malfunction triggered a fire that motivated an evacuation of datacenter personnel and resulted in region wide degradation. At this time requests that utilized storage in the impacted region saw increased latency and elevated error rates. This resulted in elevated request rates due to retries and longer request times. We remediated the issue by updating the storage policies to reroute the requests to another region that was still compliant with residency requirements, and by updating the behavior of internal retry and rate limiting logic.  \n  \n**Corrective Actions**  \nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Update internal rate limiting logic to trigger automatic scale-out sooner\n* Update monitoring for all storage locations\n* Audit request timeouts\n* Extend automated health checking and automated policy re-routing to cover additional degradation cases\n\n  \nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting the Box Web App and public API. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn April 19, 2023 between 21:02 and 22:02 \\(Pacific Time\\),  some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, these users experienced slowness and intermittent failures interacting with certain parts of the Box Web App and public API, including Logins, Uploads and Downloads. The issue occurred as a result of an internal process overloading the database pod responsible for serving approximately 1% of our customers. We were able to resolve the issue by stopping the internal process that was stressing the database. In addition, we have already started the process of upsizing and splitting the database as part of our routine maintenance for busy database pods to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis**\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, the database pod on which this issue took place was identified as a candidate for splitting due to organic growth of the database. The split successfully completed in May 2022. In December 2022, the database pod was once again identified as a candidate for splitting due to additional organic growth since the previous split.  The second split kicked off in December and was estimated to complete in 8 weeks. However, a latent bug caused duplicate processing of some of the data on the pod; as a result, the split took longer than originally planned.  Load on the database pod continued to increase while the split was taking place and occasionally reached levels that were not sustainable, resulting in impact such as what was seen on April 19. While waiting for the split to be completed, the database pod was migrated onto more powerful hardware, providing some relief. The database split ultimately completed at the end of April 2022.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improve our database split process to reduce duplicative processing, improve efficiency in performing splits, and better scoping completion timeline. \n\n* Identify even earlier database pods that require a database split\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time, some users experienced slowness and intermittent failures interacting with certain parts of the Box webapp and public API, including while applying Box Shield Classifications and sending documents for signature via Box Sign. The issue occurred as a result of a gradual new feature rollout that overwhelmed a cache held inside one of the key middleware services. We were able to resolve the issue by deploying a code change that prevented the feature rollout framework from overwhelming the cache and restarting the impacted service to clear the cache. In addition, we are working on improving monitoring and alerting around the impacted cache to be able to detect and address similar problems before they impact our users in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOur investigation shows that the incident was caused by an inefficient configuration of the experimentation framework that was used to begin gradual rollout of a new feature. This framework unexpectedly stored decision results in the cache, regarding whether the feature should be shown to the user. This decision storage overran the cache, causing other entries to be evicted. This meant that the web application ended up having to reconstitute the frequently used and expensive to compute information that would have ordinarily been in this cache. The effective capacity of our web application processing was thus dramatically reduced, which caused exhaustion and subsequent degradation of several of our latency sensitive services. The incident remediation was slowed down significantly by the lack of explicit alerting on the web application server’s cache.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Fix the experimentation framework such that it doesn’t overwhelm the web application server’s cache\n* Add explicit monitoring and alerting around the usage of the web application server’s cache\n* Implement a fast way to clear the web application server caches on the entire server fleet\n* Add explicit monitoring and alerting around expensive operations performed by the web application server that should ordinarily be performed rarely due to being cached effectively\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

This decision storage overran the cache, causing other entries to be evicted. This meant that the web application ended up having to reconstitute the frequently used and expensive to compute information that would have ordinarily been in this cache. The effective capacity of our web application processing was thus dramatically reduced, which caused exhaustion and subsequent degradation of several of our latency sensitive services. The incident remediation was slowed down significantly by the lack of explicit alerting on the web application server’s cache.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Fix the experimentation framework such that it doesn’t overwhelm the web application server’s cache\n* Add explicit monitoring and alerting around the usage of the web application server’s cache\n* Implement a fast way to clear the web application server caches on the entire server fleet\n* Add explicit monitoring and alerting around expensive operations performed by the web application server that should ordinarily be performed rarely due to being cached effectively\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 11:00 AM PT and 1:21 PM PT on April 7, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, Box Sign users were unable to start the signing process using the upload new file feature. Users were presented with an error banner when uploading new documents. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change made to standardize error code messages, which inadvertently impacted an internal interaction. We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back the relevant change. In addition, we have identified several corrective actions, detailed below, to minimize the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nAs part of an effort to standardize error codes returned in API responses, we rolled out a change that updated some existing codes. This change impacted an internal interaction, in the Box Sign document upload flow, that was explicitly relying on a prior error code value. When the relevant error situation arose, the code was unable to detect and mitigate the recoverable error, resulting in it being propagated out to the end-user in the form of an error banner.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Added additional tests to prevent modifications of existing error codes until it is deemed safe to do so.\n* Started the process to deprecate custom error code values, only keeping the standardized HTTP response codes.\n* Augmenting continuous end-to-end testing on pre-production environments for increased observability around critical user journeys.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, customers may have experienced delays when using Box Relay. We would like to take this opportunity to provide an analysis of this issue and the corrective actions we have taken in response.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred due to one of our services in a specific region experiencing high latency when communicating with a backend cloud database. This caused the service in that region to run in a degraded state. We were able to resolve the issue by routing all of the upstream traffic to another region where the service was healthy. In addition, we are working with the cloud service provider to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\nThe existing logs and metrics we had during the incident did not reveal any indication as to what might have caused the degradation. So, following the recommendation from our cloud provider, we temporarily enabled extensive cloud logging for that region, diverted some traffic and monitored the service for degradation. The service was not degraded during this time. While the extensive logging has since been disabled, we have continued to closely monitor the service in that region and have not observed any anomalies or further signs of degradation.  We will continue to monitor for any anomalies.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Our existing metrics promptly alert the on-call engineer when such issues occur.  We have additionally made the following changes to our runbook that the on-call follows:\n\n    * Enable the extensive cloud logging and seek immediate assistance from the cloud provider on the issue.\n    * Once adequate data is gathered, divert traffic away from the degraded region.\n    \n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, some users may have experienced delays in Box Drive synchronizing changes. The issue occurred due to a regularly scheduled automatic internal credential rotation failing to propagate completely. We were able to resolve the issue by manually synchronizing the affected service with the latest credentials. In addition, we are ensuring services self-validate against the credential freshness constraints to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis**\n\nKey rotation is one aspect of the broader key management and a component Box’s overall security system, which requires key holders to update their keys regularly before they are revoked. In the event an automatic key rotation occurs and a key holder does not refresh their credentials within their valid lifetime they will no longer be able to authenticate and receive authorization to communicate with external systems. In the case of this issue, a single internal service responsible for managing realtime events did not update its credentials following an automatic rotation and thus not able to make those new events available to our customers.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Add an alert to page on-call engineers should the affected service fail to update its credentials to enable a user to investigate and manually complete the task\n* Update the affected service to add an additional automatic check for credential freshness to watch for rotations and update automatically\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting JWT logins and Box Notes. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 5:37 AM and 6:39 AM PT, 9:37 PM and 10:39 PM PT on March 21, 2023, and between 9:12 AM PT and 9:39 AM PT on March 22, 2023 some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, we noticed some JWT-based logins resulting in failures as well as an increase in disconnects within Box Notes while users tried to save or delete their Notes. The issue occurred because of a configuration change on one of our caching servers, specifically in one of our maintenance scripts. We were able to resolve the issue by quarantining the affected host and manually replacing it with a healthy one. In addition, we have hardened our automated checks, added better controls in these maintenance scripts and also improved observability on the impacted caching services in order to to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n  \n**Analysis** \n\nLogins at Box are rate limited in order to control the amount of traffic or requests that can be sent to our subsystems. During the time of the issue, the caching server that enables this rate limiting was shut down because of a misconfiguration in one of our maintenance scripts tasked with keeping our caching infrastructure up-to-date with the latest software patches. The script was trying to connect to its backend using an incorrect TLS certificate, causing the script to hang and consume system memory. Since this script runs on schedule, multiple instances of this script started over time causing it to consume more and more system resources.  Eventually, this led to insufficient resources being available for Memcached service, causing it to be terminated. Additionally, a bug in our auto-healing system prevented this caching server to be replaced with a healthy one leaving the server in service even though it was unhealthy. \n\nWhen part of the cache became unavailable, rate limiting service terminated the requests that were supposed to be cached in that server, causing approximately 30% of JWT logins to fail during that time. This same caching server was also used in the generation of OAuth2 tokens used internally within the BoxNotes service. When this cache would become unavailable, Box Notes would disconnect while trying to persist or delete a Note, since it could not validate the tokens. We noticed an increase of approximately 10% in the number of disconnects during the time of cache unavailability.\n\n  \n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Validate that all necessary TLS certificates are present on the entire caching fleet.\n* Fix the maintenance script so in case of a connection error, it terminates and does not hang and hold on to memory. \n* Fix the bug in the auto-healing system that prevented the unhealthy host from being replaced.\n* Add more specific alerts in case of failures like these, so on-call engineers are better informed.\n\n  \nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n  \nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n‌\n\nOn March 16th, 2023 between 4:30pm and 7:00pm PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users may have experienced higher than usual latencies and slightly elevated error rates when interacting with the Box website. The issue occurred due to a mistake made as part of a maintenance operation aimed at improving the efficiency and reliability of one of our foundational services. This maintenance operation resulted in fewer servers being left to serve the Box web application than were necessary to serve all incoming traffic without any customer impact. We were able to resolve the issue by restoring the necessary capacity for the impacted service. In addition, we are implementing autoscaling for this service to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe problem occurred over the course of a maintenance operation during which a legacy virtual-machine-based server fleet serving the Box web application was being replaced with a container-based fleet. Both fleets were sharing the load before the maintenance took place, and as the maintenance operation completed, only the container-based fleet remained. Although a load projection had been made prior to the maintenance and the container-based fleet was expected to be able to handle the full load of the site, it eventually became clear that our container-based fleet was struggling to keep up with demand. This resulted in higher latencies and slightly elevated error rates across the Box web application. In order to recover application performance, we put the virtual-machine-based fleet back in service to share the load with the container-based one.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* The capacity projection model for the container-based fleet has been adjusted to reflect the outcome of this maintenance. This means the more capacity will be available in the container-based fleet as we retire the virtual-machine-based fleet.\n* We are improving our observability to detect early indicators of insufficient capacity, so we can react to them before customer experience is impacted.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, some users may have encountered loading issues while trying to sign a document. The issue occurred as a result of the release of a new feature in Box Sign. In connection with this release, there was a change in a specific flow for some enterprises based on their enterprise settings.

During this time, some users were unable to search for items that were uploaded or changed during the impacted timeframe. The issue occurred as a result of an automation intended to optimize our messaging infrastructure. The automation put in place did not drive the optimization at a controlled rate, which caused overutilization of available resources and resulted in end-user impact. We resolved this issue by stopping the optimization automation. In addition, we have added guardrails to limit the optimization process to a subset of infrastructure to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future._ \n\n_Analysis_ \n\n_On the day of the incident, we observed increased disk activity in our messaging infrastructure. This was the result of an automated optimization process to balance out disk space evenly across the underlying hosts in our messaging infrastructure. The optimization process ran across all the hosts, resulting in increased disk activity that affected our search service. As a result of this issue, our search service temporarily failed to index any file changes made after the onset of the issue. As a result, we stopped the optimization automation, and as a result, we observed incremental recovery until all the messages were processed.

This caused a high internal queue build up as the system backlog built due to CPU resource contention.  As the queue size build up was significant, the recovery took some time. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* We are working towards reviewing and adding more alerting for improved diagnostics for such issues. \n* We have added a caching layer to reduce the dependency between our backend datasets and customer applications. This should reduce the potential impact to the customer experience if we face a similar issue.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 10:24am PST and 11:20am PST on February 6th, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, a subset of Box’s external load balancers became unstable due to extremely high CPU usage, which resulted in intermittent issues for customers trying to access the Box Service. The issue occurred as a result of network socket exhaustion on external load balancers which was caused by a migration of certain traffic to the public cloud. We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back the migration at issue as well as increasing available load balancer capacity. In addition, we are working on updating the required amount of resources and capacity we need in the public cloud for these migrations as well as improving our monitoring to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\n‌\n\nAs Box moves to the public cloud, we have migrated multiple workloads from our on-prem datacenters to the public cloud. The service in question is responsible for an extremely high connection count. While moving this service away from the last on-prem datacenter it occupied, the load balancers in the public cloud became temporarily overwhelmed. This resulted in the exhaustion of available network sockets for the load balancers to use. This drove up CPU usage as a result of connection retries, eventually causing instances to fail healthchecks and be recreated. As instances were being recreated, they would drop traffic and move the high connection count to a different instance, further compounding the issue. We were able to resolve this issue by rolling back the migration, which relieved the connection counts on the load balancers. Furthermore, by adding more capacity we were able to provide the necessary headroom to recover completely. We are working on adding capacity to our cloud load balancing stack and updating our monitoring to immediately point to the root cause if a similar issue is encountered in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Add additional capacity to the public cloud load balancing stack\n* Update existing monitoring to account for network socket usage and exhaustion\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future._\n\n‌\n\n_Between February 3, 2023 at 9:09 PM PST and February 4, 2023 at 11:20 AM PST, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users may have experienced failures when attempting to upload or download content to Box. We were able to resolve the issue by deploying additional resources and scaling up our services. In addition, we are working on improving our change management process to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future._ \n\n‌\n\n_Analysis _\n\n_The issue was a result of a change from HTTP metrics communication in the region to HTTPS metrics communication. This change failed and resulted in a communication failure between our metrics agent and the metric sink it writes to. During the communication failure, the metrics agent will locally cache the data up to a max capacity. In our deployments, we did not have enough resources deployed for this cache. The impact was resource exhaustion in a cluster running our upload and download services resulting in frequent service restarts due to an out-of-memory exception_\n\n‌\n\n_Corrective Actions_\n\n_The following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:_\n\n* _Increased the deployment resources to allow for the additional capacity_ \n* _Added specific alerting for this scenario_ \n\n‌\n\n_We are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter._ \n\n \n\n_Sincerely,_\n\n_The Box Team_",
