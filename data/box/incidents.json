To the best of our knowledge, this is the current state and we will update as more information is confirmed._\n\n \n\nBetween **January 23rd 11:46am PST** and **January 26th 3:11pm PST**, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, a newly re-deployed load balancer instance had a faulty network connection which caused it to be unreachable from our internal network resulting in timeouts for any traffic that it processed, ultimately resulting in users seeing their uploads or downloads timeout. The issue occurred due to incorrect automated networking setup of the new load balancer instance**.** We were able to resolve the issue by removing the faulty instance from the pool. In addition, we are working on improving our health-checks for newly deployed instances to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\nWe are conducting a full engineering postmortem and our overview is subject to change with further analysis and findings. We will publish the results as soon as we have concluded our investigation.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, some users of certain Box features such as Notes and the Box Office Online integration may have experienced an increase in latency and errors. We believe the problem was caused by temporarily increased latency in interacting with a third-party cloud provider. The problem was resolved as the increased latencies decreased.\n\nWe are conducting a full engineering postmortem with the third party cloud provider. Our overview is subject to change with further analysis and findings. We will publish the results as soon as we have concluded our investigation.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 3:30pm PDT and 4:17pm PDT on Jan 9th, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working on the Box platform. During this time, users may have experienced slow login times as well as failures when attempting to upload and download files. \n\n## **Analysis**\n\nThe issue occurred as an unexpected result of a resource utilization priority conflict during the deployment process of an internal tool. Specifically, an internal service being deployed to our production environment had a higher resource utilization priority than another critical system process, which subsequently failed when affected nodes’ resources were exhausted. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the change.\n\nIn addition, we are improving our change risk assessment criteria and health alerts for this kind of tool, and working to design a more progressive deployment process for this internal tool to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n## **Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improving our risk assessment criteria for deploying these types of tools. \n\n* Extending our capacity guidelines to provide more clarity around system resource consumption and better resource distribution.\n* Increasing our alerting to detect early warning signs of systems running at a higher capacity than expected.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, some users may have experienced higher than normal latency and/or timeouts when trying to access content in Box via one of our applications or our Public API.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 5:16 PM PDT and 7:40 PM PDT on November 23, 2022, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, it was not possible to access Shield Admin pages, the Shield Admin dashboard and the Classification Label admin pages. Additionally, some users may have experienced issues manually classifying files and folders. The issue occurred as a result of an inadequate capacity configuration that prevented a service from starting gracefully after rebooting. We were able to resolve the issue by increasing the capacity of the affected service. In addition, we are working to extend our capacity guidelines and to improve our alerting capabilities to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe service affected by this incident recently experienced a significant increase in traffic as a result of the release of a new feature. Although the service remained stable after the feature’s release, the temporary degradation of another supporting service resulted in an increased number of retries, which in turn resulted in increased processing activity. As a result of this increased CPU usage, the impacted service eventually rebooted, but was unable to effectively reboot because the memory currently allocated for that service was inadequate during this window of increased processing activity. We were able to resolve the issue by increasing the capacity of the affected service.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Extending our capacity guidelines to provide more clarity around system restart considerations.\n* Increasing our alerting to detect early warning signs of systems running at a higher capacity than expected.\n* Improving the documentation of our existing alerts to allow us to respond more quickly to system reboot issues.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, permissions checks were not available for certain workflows, which caused multiple services to stop allowing access. The issue occurred due to a non-backward-compatible change that was introduced while adding a feature intended to improve the performance of permissions checks. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the change. In addition, we are working to improve our testing and monitoring processes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis**\n\nPermissions checks depend on a schema. In order to make checks faster, we are adding support for bulk lookups, a feature that will reduce the number of requests to other internal services and thus improve the response time.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween November 15, 2022 at 7:12 am PST and November 16, 2022 at 3:04 am PST, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, customers may have experienced preview conversion latencies for Sharepoint or Microsoft Excel files. The issue occurred as a result of a reduction of available conversion capacity as part of ongoing data center migrations. We were able to resolve the issue by provisioning additional capacity in their place. In addition, operational process and tooling will be implemented to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nAs part of a data center migration, hosts for the conversion service were removed from production before replacement capacity was brought online, resulting in a 15% loss to conversion capacity. The capacity loss and root cause were identified right away and additional capacity was brought online to compensate. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Process updates have been enabled to better facilitate communication between Infrastructure and Capacity teams to minimize the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future.\n* Changes to automation for the validation of capacity requests have been enacted.\n* Canary rollout of windows related changes for the conversion service will be enabled. \n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

This issue occurred as a result of missing a critical step in a regular database maintenance procedure, which resulted in missing indices on the file table. As a result, the File Requests service experienced some latency. Additionally, Workflow Tasks users experienced an outage that manifested as UI errors.

During this time, some Box users may have experienced issues with uploads, downloads, notes and public API. The issue occurred as a result of a latent issue with platform workload initialization controllers failing to detect new workloads. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue was the result of a controller component that provides service-to-service authentication failing to detect that new workloads needed to be processed. This controller monitors an internal API for new workloads that match certain criteria indicating that the workloads are initializing and waiting for internal credentials. In this case, the impacted controller failed to detect new workloads waiting in the API results that should have been processed. We were able to resolve the issue by restarting the controllers and the new workloads were processed. In addition, we also added alerts to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. The existing alerting in place was monitoring the controllers for errors, but because the controllers were idle, no alerts were immediately raised. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improve alerting on the workloads if they time out while waiting for the controller to process them.\n* Replace the controller with a more robust method of authenticating workloads.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n‌\n\nBetween between 07:42 AM and 08:47 AM PDT on September 14, 2022 , some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, customers may have experienced issues with SSO Logins and Box Notes. The issue occurred due to a failure in the network connecting one of our points of presence \\(POPs\\) to Box’s Application Data Center \\(ADC\\).  We were able to resolve the issue by implementing backbone routing changes to bypass the affected network path**.** In addition, we are working towards migrating to the public cloud to leverage their diverse and global network to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue was the result of a network failure affecting one of our POPs. These POPs possess two redundant transport circuits that are on diverse physical paths and are provided by two separate providers providing redundant connectivity. During this incident, the impacted POP experienced simultaneous failures of both of its redundant circuits due to separate service provider incidents. \n\n‌\n\nSimultaneous failure of both transport circuits is a rare occurrence; in this case, the root cause was identified by the service providers as a “fiber cut“.  This dual failure isolated the impacted POP from the rest of the network. In response, we implemented a temporary backbone routing change to resolve the issue at that time, which temporarily diverted the impacted traffic to a sub-optimal path. Later the connectivity was restored to the original preferred path when one of the circuit recovered. After that, the second circuit also recovered, thereby restoring the redundant connectivity to the POP. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* We have migrated 100% of our edge traffic to GCP. By doing this we have further reduced the dependence on on-premise POPs. \n* This now enables us to leverage Google’s global POP presence, further improving our global reach close to the customer location.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain this issue and the steps we have taken to keep it from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 09:48 AM PDT and 10:15 AM PDT on July 8, 2022, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users experienced high latency and errors on JWT Login, Upload, Download, API and Box Notes features. The issue occurred because of an error in applying a configuration change to our traffic rate limiting infrastructure. We were able to quickly identify and resolve resolve the issue by rolling back the affecting change. Below is a summary of our analysis and corrective actions to prevent similar impact going forward. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe configuration change that caused the impact is related to our API infrastructure.  Part of the infrastructure is a component that controls the allowable request rate for various API endpoints based on a number of factors.  These factors are controlled by a configuration file.  Our engineering team was updating this configuration file to add a new rate limit entry when they applied an entry missing a required parameter.  As a result, the rate limiter system could not load its configuration, which caused the system to fail.\n\nAs a result of this incident we have identified a few key areas for improvement. First, we are improving our procedures regarding changes to the rate limiting system, adding more detail specifying required parameters and sample configurations for use in validating requests.  We have also conducted additional training with the team to reinforce the procedure. Additionally, we are investing in better automated validation of requests when they are submitted, ensuring they are well formed \\(i.e., they contain all required parameters\\).  This investment will reduce the likelihood of an incorrect configuration being applied to the system.  We believe the combination of automated configuration validation and improved documentation and training significantly improves our rate limiting system and mitigates similar future mistakes.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improving our procedures regarding changes to the rate limiting system by adding more detail and sample configurations for use in validating requests.\n* Conducting additional training to reinforce the procedure for making changes to the rate limiting system.\n* Improving automated validation of requests to minimize the likelihood of incorrect configurations in the future.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nOn July 7th, 2022 between 6:02 PM PDT and 7:10 PM PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have experienced higher than normal latency, timeouts and/or errors when trying to access Box via one of our applications or our public API. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue occurred due to instability in one of our HBase clusters. To improve the capacity of the Box Metadata service, our engineering teams deployed an expanded data storage cluster on the afternoon of July 7th. This cluster was tested prior to its deployment, and performed as expected in production immediately after deployment. Approximately 3 hours after the deployment of this cluster, a single server within the cluster exhibited dramatically increased latency caused by a defective memory module. This resulted in users experiencing degradation of uploads, downloads, Box Notes, and other related services. Our automated server failure detection methods did not detect this server as failed, and as a result, traffic continued to be directed to this server. Requests to this server developed a backlog, which affected latency of Box Metadata generally, which resulted in timeout errors and slow performance in other Box services. We were able to resolve the issue by diverting traffic to a healthy passive cluster. In addition, we are working on process and tooling improvements to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* The defective server was removed from service and repairs effected.\n* Revised datastore cluster deployment, onboarding and validation processes to prevent this issue from recurring in the future and to improve detection of problematic deployments.\n* Improving resilience of Box services to high latencies when accessing datastores to minimize the impact of any similar issues in the future. \n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn June 22, 2022 between 01:37pm PDT and 01:46pm PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have had trouble accessing Box Notes.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nIn connection with a planned update to Box Notes, certain traffic was inadvertently deployed to an incorrect data center. This caused users to temporarily encounter errors when trying to access Box Notes. We were able to resolve the issue by redeploying traffic to the correct data center. In addition, we are making changes to our documentation and building automated safeguards to prevent this issue from happening again in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Updating internal processes and documentation to check for potential issues prior to deployment.\n* Incorporating additional automations to safeguard against incorrect deployments.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn June 7, 2022 between 7:03 PM and 8:33 PM PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, Downloads, Uploads, Notes, and Public API were impacted. \n\n **Analysis**\n\nThe issue occurred when one of our internal services experienced abnormally high traffic and accumulated more requests than it could handle. Due to the abnormally high traffic, the impacted service was temporarily unable to keep up with demand, which caused the service to fail. As a result, some users were not able to download files or experienced delays while working in Box.  We were able to resolve the issue by allocating more hardware capacity to the service. In addition, we are working on improving our capacity planning and testing processes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nTo prevent issues of this type from happening again, the following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Increasing hardware allocation to the affected services to reduce the likelihood that these services will experience similar issues. \n* Making improvements to our capacity planning and testing processes to reduce the likelihood of this issue recurring in the future.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n Sincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

Specifically, the scanners were configured in a manner that caused an excessive number of authentication sessions on our network devices. This caused some network devices to run out of memory, which in turn resulted in slow login times as well as failures when attempting to upload and download files. The issue was resolved by stopping the scan. We have identified the root cause of the issue to be inefficient scan configurations. Moving forward, we are implementing more efficient scan configurations and improving our heath check alerting for all related vulnerability scans to prevent similar issues from occurring again in the future. \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Implementing configuration changes to all related security scans\n* Health check alerting for all related vulnerability scans\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, uploads, downloads, logins, and public API experienced some failures or errors.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe issue occurred when the leader node of an internal clustered system failed a soft restart. During a maintenance window, an internal infrastructure system that uses a leader-standby clustering model failed to elect a new leader. As a result, some users experienced issues with uploads, downloads, logins, and public API. Additionally, during the impacted timeframe, internal client services of the system did not rely on cached data as a fall-back, which exacerbated the issue.

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting the Enterprise Events API. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 3:18am PDT and 5:08am PDT on April 8th, 2022, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some requests to the Enterprise Events API returned errors. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred due to a misconfiguration in the underlying database.  Patching of the distributed data store for Enterprise Events temporarily brought the cluster into a bad state; as a result, the service responsible for Enterprise Events queries experienced request timeouts. We were able to resolve the issue by restarting the impacted service, which returned it to its baseline performance. In addition, we are working on improving our automated alerting and recovery mechanisms to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Standardizing connection handling and health checks on the affected service to prevent recurrence and automate recovery.\n\n* Updating the incident response process to improve recovery time for the affected service.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nOn February 1st between 3:03 pm and 4:14 pm PT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, the Box Sign user interface may not have been accessible for some users and signed documents may have been processed with a delay. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nOn February 1st networking and firewall changes were made in our ongoing effort to improve performance and stability. Due to this change our services were unable to reach out to an external service required for digitally signing documents. \n\nOur deployment/QA process did not test each individual external endpoint, and so this issue was not identified in the deployment/QA process. In addition, some alarms were misconfigured that would have reduced service degradation.  We were able to resolve the issue by whitelisting this external endpoint. \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improvements to our deployment/QA processes to test each individual endpoint for infrastructure changes. \n\n* Reconfiguration of alarms and improvements to observability with more granular alarms.\n\n* Improvements to our replay process that can restart failed tasks to mitigate consequences should other issues resulting in failed task occur in the future.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, a subset of users utilizing Box for EMM may have encountered an error while attempting to log on. The issue occurred as a result of a configuration change that resulted in customers using EMM being unable to authenticate to Box. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the change. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe impacted back-end service accesses encrypted content from Box’s database by use of an encryption key. This key was previously supplied from our configuration system. Recently, Box migrated certain keys and other sensitive information to a different system. This migration resulted in a misconfiguration, which caused the service to be unable to properly read the key. As a result, a subset of customers may have experienced errors while attempting to log on.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improving Mobile EMM testing processes\n* Enabling infrastructure to test EMM use cases in internal environments\n* Improving alerting and monitoring capabilities of critical mobile services\n* Making improvements to the back-end service to handle custom key-names and improve error messaging to help diagnose issues faster\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n Between January 12, 2022 at 9:50 PM PT until January 13, 2022 at 1:51 AM PT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, customers were not able to access Box Sign. The issue occurred due to a new firewall change, and we were able to resolve the issue by rolling back the new change. \n\n  \n**Analysis** \n\nThe problematic change had previously been pushed to our development environment without any issues. When pushing the change into our staging and production environments, there was a misconfiguration in the firewall change that blocked some traffic. The change was pushed to staging first, but a misconfiguration in our oncall alerts prevented the alert from properly reaching the oncalls. After 6 hours, this change was implemented in production with the same misconfiguration, which resulted in some service communications being blocked. A mix of the misconfiguration of oncall notification alerts and lack of proactive notifications of changes and change data caused diagnosis of this issue to take extra time.\n\n  \n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Changing configurations to correct the oncall notification alert configuration.\n\n* Changing practices to improve proactive notification of changes and change data. \n\n  \nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

          "body": "UPDATED as of 2/4/2022 6:50 AM\n\nWe recently addressed issues affecting Box Web, Uploads/Downloads, Notes, and Mobile Applications. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 4:00 PM PST and 6:53 PM PST on January 12, 2022, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, Box users in the APAC region may have experienced poor performance and increased latency while using Box. The issue occurred as a result of a misconfiguration that impacted the addition of a new Internet transit provider in the APAC region. We were able to resolve the issue by disabling BGP traffic to the new provider. In addition, we have modified our BGP policy and are working with our vendor to address a misconfiguration on their side to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nAs part of our ongoing effort to improve the customer experience for users in the APAC region, Box added a new Internet transit provider. However, as a result of a misconfiguration, this new provider began taking traffic from some customer networks that should not have been routed over the circuit. As a result of this unexpected traffic, the new circuit became oversaturated, resulting in the performance issues and increased latency. We were able to resolve the issue by disabling BGP traffic to the new provider and are gradually increasing traffic in a slow, controlled manner to prevent performance issues from reoccurring.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* We have worked with the vendor to identify the underlying issue and conduct a formal post-mortem on the vendor's side.\n\n* We are gradually increasing traffic in a slow, controlled manner to this new provider. \n\n* We are addressing a monitoring gap that prevented us from detecting the issue earlier.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team\n\n‌\n\n_Notice and disclaimer: Box is providing this preliminary information subject to further review and analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the current state and we will update as more information is confirmed._\n\n‌\n\nOn January 12, 2022 between 4:00 PM PST and 7:00 PM PST, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users of Box in Japan experienced increased latency and poor performance. The issue occurred as a result of a recent link addition introduced to improve performance for users in other APAC regions. We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back the change. In addition, we are evaluating options to gradually increase service to this new provider to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\nWe are conducting a full engineering postmortem and our overview is subject to change with further analysis and findings. We will publish the results as soon as we have concluded our investigation.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.  \n\nBetween December 16, 2021 at 9:00 am PT and January 5, 2022 at 8:08 am PT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some admin reports reflecting data about the current state of a Box deployment may have been out of date. Reports on actions taken, such as the User Activity Report, were not affected. The issue occurred due to a faulty maintenance operation that temporarily prevented us from updating the data used to generate the affected reports. We were able to resolve the issue by adjusting the system to be more reliable and handle extra data. In addition, we have revised our maintenance procedures to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue was triggered by a routine maintenance operation that was incorrectly executed. This left the process that provides updated data from our database to the admin reporting feature in an unusual state that our monitoring failed to identify as problematic. Though the available data became increasingly recent as the issue was remediated, it took time to fully recover given the backlog of updates that this issue created.  \n**Corrective Actions**  \nThe following corrective actions have been completed:\n\n* Hardened monitoring to handle edge cases that can arise during known maintenance procedures and immediately alert if deviations are detected\n\n* Tuned the affected process to be resilient in the face large backlogs\n\n* Increased capacity to process data well in excess of normal operations  \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.   \n\nSincerely,  \n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "\\*\\*\\*UPDATED: Oct 18, 2021 @ 12:41 PM PT\n\nWe recently addressed issues affecting uploads via Box Embed Widget and a subset of accelerated uploads. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 1:00PM PDT on September 23, 2021 and 10:23PM PDT on September 27, 2021, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, customers uploading via Box Embed Widget would see an error notification and multiple uploads of the same file. For customers uploading via accelerated nodes with the IP Allowlist feature enabled, users experienced errors in the upload. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change in our upload service intended to clean up some deprecated pathways. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the change and restoring to a previous known version. In addition, we are adding several new tests and alerts as part of the deployment process to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n**Analysis** \n\nAs part of regular updates, an upload service deployment was done in production. This change incorrectly overwrote a header that is used by downstream services to determine the original context of the upload. As such, in the Embed Widget case, the downstream service failed to recognize that CORS headers need to be set in the response. This caused errors only on the client side, which were not visible to the service. Corrective actions are being taken to ensure both the client and server side is aware of this change going forward in a timely manner.\n\nIn the IP Allowlisting and accelerated nodes case, the upload was not recognized to be from the original source through accelerated node and thus failed authorization check.\n\nWe were able to resolve the issue by reverting the change and restoring to a previous known version.

During this time, some customers experienced issues uploading files to Box via the Box Embed Widget and for a subset of accelerated uploads. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change in our upload service to clean up some deprecated pathways. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the change and restoring to a previous known version. In addition, we are adding several new tests and alerts as part of the deployment process to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\nWe are conducting a full engineering postmortem and our overview is subject to change with further analysis and findings.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n From August 31, 2021 at 5:30 am PDT to September 11, 2021 at 12:47 PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, customers experienced stale data in certain Batch Admin Reports. The issue occurred as a result of latent scale issues. We were able to resolve the issue by tuning configurations in our ingestion pipeline. In addition, we are working on a more scalable ingestion pipeline to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe pipeline that ingests data to be used for reports relies on temporary buffer tables before compacting the data into final tables. The buffer tables have an index to keep track of all of its files. These indexes require maintenance to avoid placing an undue strain on the system. In this case, the size of the indexes and resulting strain created a backlog that impacted data freshness of Batch Admin Reports.\n\nWe are currently working on an overhaul of how we ingest and maintain the data for reports. In this system, the index will constantly be maintained and not put pressure on the system.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Truncate the buffer tables indexes\n\n* Add additional metrics to root cause the issue faster\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n Sincerely,\n\nThe Box Team\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n_Notice and disclaimer: Box is providing this preliminary information subject to further review and analysis.

          "body": "_Updated Nov 11, 2021_\n\nWe recently addressed issues affecting the Box Web Application. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n Between 6:30 p.m. PDT on August 29, 2021 and 12:30 p.m. PDT on August 30, 2021**,** some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some request may have taken longer than usual to complete and some uploads may have failed. The issue occurred due to a misconfiguration of a third-party library used to increase performance. We were able to resolve the issue by optimizing the library for use within the Web Application. In addition, we have set up active monitoring of this library to quickly diagnose similar issues going forward.\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe Box Web Application has a caching layer built in to store frequently used values in order to improve response time to requests. A change in usage caused the internal cache memory to become fragmented, resulting in some servers taking longer to serve requests, and adding load to downstream systems serving cached values. This extra load caused cascading failures and resulted in some uploads failing.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* We will now be immediately alerted when servers are unable to cache values due to fragmentation\n\n* Cache tuning was improved to make fragmentation extremely unlikely\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n Sincerely,\n\nThe Box Team\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe recently addressed issues affecting timeliness of the Events API. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 8:43 am PDT and 3:25 pm PDT on August 30th, 2021, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, the real-time Events API sporadically experienced unusual latency. The issue occurred as a result of performance issues in the backing store that powers our Events API. We were able to resolve the issue by migrating traffic to our secondary cluster. In addition, we have increased capacity and conducted additional performance tuning on the cluster to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nOn the morning of August 30th, 2021, the backing store that powers the Events API experienced performance degradation under the load of read traffic that was querying it.  This caused requests to intermittently fail until we migrated traffic to our secondary cluster.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Apply additional performance tuning changes to our database cluster to increase performance.\n* Increase capacity for both of the database clusters to better service the higher read traffic volume.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 9:22am PDT and 9:50am PDT on August 20th 2021, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, the Box User Events API endpoint may have been delayed. The issue occurred due to internal coordination and configuration system being in a degraded state.  We were able to resolve the issue by restarting the leader of the coordination system manually. To further prevent similar issues from occurring in the future we are implementing an automatic restart mechanism for this condition.\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOur internal messaging system at Box utilizes a common orchestration system to control various aspects of the service.  This orchestration system became degraded due to resource contention issues, which caused other systems to be negatively impacted.  As a result, our database cluster that powers the User Events API was delayed in returning responses to user requests.  Upon restarting the impacted systems we were able to successfully restore service.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Automatic detection and remediation of the impacted coordination service.\n\n* Reduction of extraneous logging to reduce resource contention.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n Sincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, Enterprise Reports could not be generated. The issue occurred as a result of an image dependency that was reverted within one of our cloud vendors' environments. As a result, the service was temporarily unable to provision computational resources to execute the report jobs. We were able to resolve the issue by rebuilding the images. In addition, we are working to increase our monitoring sensitivity to such failures and reviewing our image lifecycles to prevent similar vendor issues from impacting customers in the future. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nOne of Box's cloud vendors made a change to cloud compute dependencies that our Enterprise Reports image pipeline leverages as part of creating computational resources for job execution.  After the next run of our image pipeline, the Enterprise Report job image included a failing dependency from our cloud vendor.  After  our cloud vendor reverted the problematic change and Box generated a new image, Box's Enterprise Reports were able to resume successfully.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Increase monitoring sensitivity to report-generation failures\n\n* Review image lifecycles to limit the potential impact of dependency changes\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting timeliness of the Events API. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn Thursday, July 8, 2021 between 1:15PM PT and 4:05PM PT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, notifications may have slowed down for some users, and some Drive users may have experienced delays. This issue occurred as a result of an unexpected surge in traffic because of an internal migration. We were able to resolve the issue by adding more capacity to the affected service. In addition, we have added alerts to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n  \n\n**Analysis** \n\nA migration involving one of Box's backend services caused a sudden uptick in the incoming traffic to our messaging pipeline. Due to a preset protective limit, some of that incoming traffic was restricted, causing certain events to slow down.  The engineers investigating the issue were able to add additional capacity to the messaging service, and the issue resolved soon thereafter. \n\n  \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Adding additional capacity to the messaging pipeline\n\n* Adding new alerts to page the on-call engineers when traffic to the messaging pipeline is close to hitting the preset limit\n\n  \n\n  \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",
