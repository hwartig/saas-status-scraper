To the best of our knowledge, this is the current state and we may update as more information is confirmed._\n\n‌\n\nBetween 9:33pm PT on June 3, 2024 and 1:28pm PT on June 4, 2024, a small number of users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During that time, impacted users experienced increased latencies and error rates when using Box Search. The issue occurred when our Search Infrastructure entered a state that impaired its ability to handle high query load.  In particular, search shards handling high query volumes became unhealthy, leading to frequent node restarts that resulted in sporadically slow or dropped queries. Because of a unique confluence of factors, the root cause proved challenging to diagnose and mitigate, extending time to resolution.\n\n‌\n\nWe are conducting a full engineering review, and we may publish updates in the event there are additional relevant findings.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.\n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

Over the course of this period, there were several 60-90 second time intervals when logins and various other functionality was impaired. This issue occurred due to a recent change in our token rotation process as part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the security of our systems. We resolved the problem by overriding the process and updating the expired tokens. Additionally, we are actively working on improving our testing procedures to prevent similar issues from happening again in the future.\n\n‌\n\nWe are conducting a full engineering postmortem and our overview is subject to change with further analysis and findings. In the event our continuing investigation yields further substantive findings, we may publish additional analysis after the conclusion of the full engineering postmortem.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 10:00 PM PST and 10:23 PM PST on April 24, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some Box customers might have experienced elevated error rate or increased latency with Box API requests. The issue occurred due to an unexpected failure during a MySQL Instance failover that was executed in response to high load on one of the database instances. We were able to resolve the issue by manually executing the instance failover. In addition, we have implemented a new discovery mechanism that improves the time to detect and propagate a MySQL topology change to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nDuring the incident, a failover was executed for a MySQL leader that had high CPU usage. The failover process failed to propagate the topology change and caused the impact to Box API success rate. The issue was remediated by executing the rest of the failover steps manually and the impact recovered once the new topology was successfully propagated to other components. The root cause of high CPU usage was later determined to be organic increase in week over week traffic and the impacted instance was upsized to add more CPU cores.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* The Database instance that had high CPU Usage was scaled up to add more CPU cores\n* Additionally, we are looking into remapping the Database instances to normalize the load on the impacted instance.\n* A MySQL Topology Discovery mechanism that significantly improves time to detect and propagate topology updates has been rolled out. This new mechanism improves mean time to recovery \\(MTTR\\) for similar issues in the future.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, some users might have not been able to access Box Notes. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change in our ongoing effort to improve user experience and stability of our application. We were able to resolve the issue by releasing a missing configuration value in production. In addition, we are working to improve our safety and efficiency of our release process to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\n‌\n\nThe code change responsible for the issue in object was caused by a missing configuration value in production settings. As a result, all instances of Notes using the new version image were unable to open and experienced downtime.\n\n‌\n\nDuring this incident, we identified certain gaps that contributed to this issue or resulted in longer-than-normal remediation, all of which we are working to address. First, this issue exposed a gap in our validation process for production configurations either before deployment or during server startup. Additionally, this issue did not trigger any alerts and was not visible through tracked metrics like SLO and UA graphs, which resulted in a lack of visibility of this issue. Finally, the deployment process for Notes servers does not allow for immediate rollbacks due to statefulset rollout taking approximately 45 minutes to complete, and our current incremental deployment process leaves us without a fully safe data center option as fallback.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Implementing production setting configuration safety improvements to reduce the likelihood of similar issues occurring again in the future.\n* Creating alerts on client-side JS errors to improve alerting and visibility of such issues.\n* Improving Notes incremental release safety to improve our deployment processes and facilitate more effective remediation of issues with deployments.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 2:41 AM and 2:51 PM PDT on March 26, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box Sign. During this time, the users were unable to send manual reminders for pending Sign requests, and delete sign requests in the WebApp. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred as a result of a recent code change made to improve Box Sign functionality. The issue presented itself in the sign mechanism for request handling, resulting in the sign reminder and delete functionalities not being available to the users. Incomplete automated testing coverage and pre-release checks for the functionalities mentioned above allowed the issue to go undetected before production deployment. We were able to quickly resolve the issue by performing a rollback of the sign web service. In addition, we are working on improving our monitoring system, pre-release quality check procedures, engineering on-call documentation and the robustness of the sign request handling mechanism to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Enhancing monitoring and alerts graphs in the sign service\n* Increasing the integration test coverage of the area affected in the incident \\(and adjacent ones\\)\n* Updating the sign engineering on-call documentation, as part of the effort to facilitate the improvement of detection and resolution time\n* Improving the robustness of the sign request handling mechanism\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween March 7, 2024 5:00 PM PT and March 8, 2024 3:00 AM PT, some users may have experienced difficulties while using Box AI in Box Notes and Preview. During this time, queries made to Box AI returned an error. The issue occurred due to a change to a load balancing configuration for one of our endpoints used for Box AI, which resulted in unexpected credential issues. We were able to resolve the issue by fixing the configuration and improving the resiliency of our system. In addition, we have increased alerting and implemented more monitoring and logging to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nAt Box, we are always striving to improve the efficiency and fault tolerance of our services. The AI team implemented a change to resolve latency issues in our services. A misconfiguration in this change temporarily resulted in AI query failures, which we were able to resolve by identifying and addressing the problematic configuration settings. Additionally, the issue revealed some gaps in our alerting and testing systems, as well as gaps in our internal team process, both of which impacted remediation time.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Add in more alerting and automated processes to prevent future complications\n* Improve observability by adding in more logs, metrics and tracing throughout the system.\n* Improve testing reliability by making testing environments mirror production environments.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 1:00PM PT and 1:40PM PT on March 7, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users were not able to access files stored in Box folders. The issue occurred as a result of a deployment of a data access service in our ongoing effort to improve the scalability of Box’s infrastructure. While deploying this service, a central control plane component became overloaded and was unable to propagate new data access instance information to the applications. We were able to resolve the issue by scaling up the control plane component. In addition, we are working to over-provision the control plane component and improve the monitoring and alerting to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nBox utilizes a communication layer called \"Service Mesh\" to facilitate effective communication between its services. However, a recent increase in the number of applications onboarded to Service Mesh caused the control plane component to become overloaded, resulting in delays propagating instance changes for impacted services. Before the incident occurred, several core applications underwent deployment simultaneously, including the Data Access Service. Unfortunately, the control plane failed to promptly propagate instance changes for this service. Since most user interactions with Box rely on connecting with the Data Access Service, users were unable to access files stored in Box folders during this time due to the propagation delay.\n\n‌\n\nTo address this issue and prevent future occurrences of control plane overload, we have scaled up its capacity by three times and implemented improved monitoring and alerting mechanisms.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Scaling up control plane capacity to prevent future overload issues. \n* Enhancing monitoring and alerting for the control plane status. \n* Conduct benchmark and scalability testing of the control plane in Pre-Prod environment. \n* Arrange detailed sessions with our technology vendor to optimize Box's Service Mesh infrastructure.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting file and folder counts in Box. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 4:00 PM PST on February 18, 2024 and 9:10 PM PST on February 19, 2024, updates to file and folder counts displayed in Box were delayed for some customers. The issue occurred as a result of an intentional workload migration to mitigate a partial outage in one region of one of our cloud providers.  We were able to resolve the issue by adding resources to the target region to reduce the cross-region latency impact. These delays only affected the visibility of file and folder counts; the counts themselves were maintained.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOn February 16th, a resource migration from one of our regions to another was performed as a mitigation effort for an unrelated issue. An increase in traffic on February 18th combined with the region shift resulted in a backlog in the file and folder counts workflow.\n\nWe addressed the issue by adding more resources to the new region. We are currently in the process of further consolidating the resources for this workflow to avoid significant delays and backlogs. Furthermore, to minimize the likelihood of similar situations occurring again, we are implementing checks and alerts to prevent future scenarios in which resource shortages could lead to delays in updating file and folder counts.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* We will implement checks and alerts to trigger if the workflow processing slows down and starts to back up.\n* We will add further documentation to our run book as references to be used in the event of similar region outages, ensuring that our service remains resilient to such incidents.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

There was a pre-existing discrepancy between the code and infrastructure originating from a previous operation performed in response to an unrelated incident. This discrepancy resulted in the impacted service restarting, which caused some users to experience degraded performance. \n\nWhen the change went live, the availability of the service dropped.

During this time, Box customers were unable to open or edit Microsoft Office files via Office Online. The issue occurred as a result of network connectivity issues. We were able to resolve the issue by restoring the network connectivity. In addition, we are working to make the Office Online integration more resilient to such failures, to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\nAnalysis \n\nThe Office Online integration communicates with Microsoft servers in order to provide Office for the Web capabilities for files hosted in Box. This communication happens via the Web Application Open Platform Interface \\(WOPI\\) protocol.\n\nBox performs signature validation of each WOPI command it receives. The cryptographic keys needed to perform this validation are acquired through a process called WOPI discovery. During the discovery process, Box fetches an XML file from the Microsoft servers. This file contains the keys needed to perform signature validation. The file is then cached for a period of time.\n\nPrior to the outage, the discovery endpoint for one of the Office Online environments became briefly unreachable. At the same time, the cache on the Box side expired. Box then failed to refetch the discovery XML for one of the environments, which caused the signature validation to fail in a cascading way across all other environments.\n\n‌\n\nCorrective Actions\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* The cache time-to-live for the discovery file will be increased, to reduce Box’s exposure to any failures to reach the discovery endpoint\n* Changes will be made to ensure that failures to acquire discovery information for one Office Online environment do not impact other environments\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn January 9, 2024, between 11:10 AM PT and 12:15 PM PT, users experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users experienced slowness and failures interacting with most parts of the Box webapp and public API, including Logins, Uploads and Downloads. The issue was triggered by a change that impacted Kubernetes clusters in one of the regions where we run our critical services. At 11:18 AM PT this change was rolled back. After rolling back the change, systems began to recover around 11:27 AM. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOn January 9th, 2024, we made a configuration change to deploy a new daemonset to the dedicated Kubernetes clusters running our core data services, which caused resource exhaustion and eviction of our core data services on those nodes. The daemonset deployment pipeline erroneously allowed the change to be promoted to an entire region instead of the planned gradual rollout, which resulted in service interruption impacting most of our customers. To address this issue, we rolled back the daemonset deployment. After the daemonset was rolled back, the evicted core data services began to be restored and our systems began to recover; however, in two of our three clusters, this process was delayed by a scheduler limitation, elongating the duration of impact. We adjusted the resource requests for our core data services to speed up recovery of these two clusters, restoring normal operations at 12:15pm.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* We have paused the daemonset pipeline until we can ensure it employs safe incremental rollout processes.\n* We are updating the daemonset pipeline to validate resource allocations before deployment and ensure a gradual production rollout to reduce the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future.\n* We have adjusted the priority of our application services, including the core data services, to be higher than daemonsets to ensure their capacity is protected.\n* We are adjusting our Kubernetes configurations to enable faster restoration of service through guaranteed capacity and buffers.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.\n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "## Background\n\nOn December 15, 2023 Box experienced a severe service degradation. During this time, users experienced slowness and failures interacting with all parts of the Box webapp and public API; including Logins, Uploads and Downloads. Additionally, some customers might have seen small subsets of their content created during the incident become sporadically hidden. \n\n‌\n\nThe issue was triggered by a partial power loss that impacted persistent disks in one of the cloud infrastructure availability zones in which we operate, leading to multiple active databases being impacted. Although our database infrastructure is architected with zonal redundancy, the unique nature of the failure surfaced a gap in our zonal health monitoring and presented unforeseen challenges for our automatic recovery tooling, extending the resolution time. We were ultimately able to resolve the issue by manually shifting traffic out of the impacted availability zone. \n\n## Analysis\n\nBox’s database infrastructure is designed to be able to withstand problems impacting a single availability zone. Our database replicas are spread across multiple availability zones for redundancy and we have automated tooling in place that can detect faults and shift traffic to other replicas should that become necessary. Both the redundant replicas and automated tooling are exercised regularly as part of our normal operations.\n\n‌\n\nIn this case, when the partial power loss took place, it impacted several of our databases in a way that compromised their ability to serve high traffic volumes. Diagnosing this type of partial zonal failure was challenging due to the high variability of impact across multiple databases. Because of this unique confluence of factors, the root cause proved challenging to diagnose and mitigate both for our automation and incident responders, extending time to resolution. Once we confirmed the impact was limited to a single availability zone, we were able to effectively mitigate all active databases out of the impacted zone by leveraging other availability zones.\n\n‌\n\nDuring the course of our mitigation efforts, replication topologies may have caused certain newly created files or file versions to intermittently not appear in a limited number of Box accounts. These intermittent visibility issues were resolved as replication topologies were normalized and caches were later cleared. \n\n## Next Steps and Corrective Actions\n\nWe are continuing to conduct a comprehensive engineering postmortem.  Therefore, this report is subject to change based on our further analysis and findings.\n\n‌\n\nThe following corrective actions have been, or continue to be, implemented:\n\n* improve our ability to diagnose partial availability zone degradations like the one we encountered in this incident;\n* improve our automatic incident mitigation system to better handle partial zone degradations;\n* improve our testing strategies for the database tier mitigation systems to cover this type of failure scenario; and\n* conduct a comprehensive audit of our production systems to validate their resilience to zonal failures and degradations.\n\n‌\n\nThe above noted corrective actions will strengthen our efforts to safeguard against partial zone degradations, reduce mitigation timeframes and support enhanced testing and prevention efforts.  \n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "## Background\n\nWe recently addressed issues affecting Box Webapp, Public and Uploads & Downloads. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future. \n\nBetween 4:30 AM PST and 5:05 AM PST on December 15, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During these times, some users may have experienced slowness and failures interacting  with parts of the Box Webapp and public API, including Uploads and Downloads. The issue occurred due to an issue with the deployment of a new DB Access Control service on our database fleet.  We were able to resolve the issue by temporarily disabling the problematic service. In addition, we are working to improve our testing and rollout process for services being deployed to our database fleet to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe DB Access Control service is a service that enables new user access controls to be applied automatically and frequently.  This allows for faster development of new DB functionality that requires access control changes, resulting in faster team velocity and ultimately more stable and reliable infrastructure.  \n\nOn the morning of December 13th, an operator started the rollout of the DB Access Control service by deploying it to a single database pod. At that time, it was configured to execute its work every 10 minutes.  Approximately 10 minutes after the deployment, we saw degradation on that pod, causing the impact seen on December 13. The operator suspected that the service frequency was the cause and remediated by configuring the service to execute its work once a day at a low-traffic time. The next steps should have been to validate the changes in a way that would not result in customer impact and then deploy it again on a single pod. However, the standard process was unintentionally not adhered to in this case and the change was instead deployed across the fleet, leading to additional impact as seen on December 15.\n\nIn addition to optimizing the DB Access Control service to be less resource-intensive, we intend to make some process changes in response to this issue. There is already a general standard process that should be followed when deploying services to the Database fleet. However, to minimize the likelihood of similar situations occurring again, we are updating our documentation to better ensure that all operators have a comprehensive understanding of the standard process and that such process is consistently followed. \n\n## Next Steps and Corrective Actions\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* The relevant DB service was temporarily disabled to remediate the issue.\n* The relevant DB service has been optimized to be less resource-intensive and will automatically refuse to run during high-traffic times\n* Rollout process for all DB services will be more thoroughly documented\n* Operators will receive additional training to ensure that they have a comprehensive understanding of the documented rollout process\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future. \n\n‌\n\nBetween 10:28 AM PST and 10:38 AM PST on December 13, 2023 and between 4:30 AM PST and 5:05 AM PST on December 15, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During these times, some users may have experienced slowness and failures interacting  with parts of the Box Webapp and public API, including Uploads and Downloads. The issue occurred due to an issue with the deployment of a new DB Access Control service on our database fleet.  We were able to resolve the issue by temporarily disabling the problematic service. In addition, we are working to improve our testing and rollout process for services being deployed to our database fleet to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe DB Access Control service is a service that enables new user access controls to be applied automatically and frequently.  This allows for faster development of new DB functionality that requires access control changes, resulting in faster team velocity and ultimately more stable and reliable infrastructure.  \n\n‌\n\nOn the morning of December 13th, an operator started the rollout of the DB Access Control service by deploying it to a single database pod. At that time, it was configured to execute its work every 10 minutes.  Approximately 10 minutes after the deployment, we saw degradation on that pod, causing the impact seen on December 13. The operator suspected that the service frequency was the cause and remediated by configuring the service to execute its work once a day at a low-traffic time. The next steps should have been to validate the changes in a way that would not result in customer impact and then deploy it again on a single pod. However, the standard process was unintentionally not adhered to in this case and the change was instead deployed across the fleet, leading to additional impact as seen on December 15.\n\n‌\n\nIn addition to optimizing the DB Access Control service to be less resource-intensive, we intend to make some process changes in response to this issue.

          "body": "We recently addressed an issue affecting multi-factor authentication logins. We would like to further explain the issue and action items we had taken to prevent it from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 9:00 AM PST and 12:30 PM PST on November 6, 2023, some users experienced latency and difficulty logging into Box. During this time, users logging in to Box with multi-factor authentication may have encountered slow responses or failures during the login process. Upon investigation, we determined that the cause of this issue was the result of a single enterprise repeatedly retrying programmatic session termination calls for all its users, which temporarily overburdened the multi-factor authentication service. The issue was resolved when the user was temporarily prevented from using the session termination API.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe issue occurred due a confluence of factors relating to our session termination API and multi-factor authentication service. Specifically, at the time of this issue, our session termination API did not have a rate limiter in place, which allowed a customer to repeatedly call the API with an excessive number of requests to the multi-factor authentication service. The multi-factor-authentication service additionally did not rate-limit the specific call made to it by the session termination API. Finally, the internal retry logic for timed-out requests continued to load the multi-factor authentication service. As a result, due to the unusually high session termination calls, our multi-factor authentication service became overburdened and resulted in the temporary impact to users.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Adding rate limits to the session termination API and the multi-factor authentication service.\n* Enhancing dashboard and alerts related to session termination API and multi-factor authentication.\n* Optimization of the logic between the session termination API and multi-factor authentication service to improve throughput.\n* Investigation of retry logic to prevent perpetuating overload situations.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting the Box for Salesforce Integration. We would like to take this opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 12:17 PM PDT and 7:36 PM PDT on Friday, November 3, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while using our Box for Salesforce integration. During this time, customers using the integration experienced issues loading the Box Folder widgets, toolkit automation, and authentication flows. This occurred as a result of a back-end change that resulted in the integration's authentication credentials being invalidated. We were able to resolve the issue by resetting the credentials. In addition, we are updating our change control processes and software to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\n‌\n\nThe Box Developer Console is part of our main web application, and is an interface that developers use to manage their application’s properties. The console also includes functionality to reset application credentials when necessary, which is typically reserved for credential rotations or similar scenarios. In this issue, the functionality to reset the application credentials was inadvertently triggered during other, more routine updates. As a result of these invalidated credentials, some users may have temporarily experienced difficulties using the integration. The issue was detected by Box employees within minutes of the change, and we were able to resolve the issue by restoring the application’s credentials.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Restoring the Box for Salesforce integration’s credentials\n* Update tooling and processes so that routine, low risk updates to applications are separated from rare, but necessary high risk capabilities, like resetting application credentials.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here, and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 2:32 pm and 4:05 pm PST on November 3, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, file-related notifications were temporarily delayed. The issue occurred due to an expired authentication token used in one of our environments. We were able to resolve the issue by rotating the token, at which point entire backlog of unsent notifications was sent. In addition, we are working on putting additional safeguards in place to alert us beforehand in such cases earlier to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue was caused by an expired token used to distribute software within Box infrastructure. As a result, there was temporary inability for the affected mechanism to distribute the current version of software. This has led to a number of jobs triggering continuously to pause, since these could not obtain the current version of software due to this issue. One of these jobs that was impacted was batching job for notifications, and this caused the temporary impact to end users. Due to a limitation in alerting mechanism in this area, the alert did not fire as expected as a warning beforehand. \n\n‌\n\nWe were able to resolve this issue by rotating the token, which restored the impacted functionality. Once the problem was mitigated, the notification job started firing again and quickly sent out the historical backlog of unsent notifications. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improve the token renewal alerting automation to detect and fire alerts for any expiring tokens\n* Improve the token distribution and renewal process to ensure our core infrastructure services always have valid authentication tokens\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, users were unable to find some documents that were uploaded, modified or moved during the specified period. The issue occurred as a result of changes to our infrastructure to more uniformly distribute the index across all shards in our search clusters. Specifically, a new sharding scheme was applied to our live serving search clusters resulting in some recently updated documents going to the the wrong shards. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting back to the old sharding scheme for live clusters. In addition, we are working on adding mechanisms to safely alter sharding scheme for live production clusters to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue occurred due to alteration of the sharding scheme used for indexing to live serving search clusters. This change inadvertently resulted in inconsistency between the sharding scheme used to update documents and the sharding scheme used to query the cluster. As a result, a small portion of documents that were created, updated or moved on Box during the issue time window were indexed to a different shard than what the user queries were being processed on. Since the sharding scheme only impacted a small portion of content on Box \\(less than 1%\\), most documents were still searchable, and this issue only impacted a relatively small number of files.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Adding checks in the system to ensure indexing and query pipeline are using the same sharding scheme for a specific cluster\n* Adding tooling to identify if document is being indexed to the wrong shard on a cluster\n* Update procedure for changing sharding scheme to prevent unintentionally applying it to all serving clusters.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, users may not have been able to log in, upload/download content, or interact with some components of Sign or some API endpoints. The issue occurred as the result of a configuration change affecting internal routing and DNS infrastructure. We were able to resolve the issue by restoring the original configuration. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue was caused by a configuration change intended to shift traffic between our cloud provider and on-premise infrastructure to a redundant path on the network. This configuration change inadvertently impacted our internal routing and DNS infrastructure, which certain Box services rely on for internal name resolution during network maintenance. The inability for services to resolve internal resources lead to a cascading effect of errors across several services.  After reviewing the incident it was discovered that the redundant path was missing the key route for our DNS infrastructure.  As such, part of the network path between the public cloud and on-premise datacenter were temporarily disrupted. \n\n‌\n\nAs part of Box’s migration to public cloud, our traditional datacenter network was connected to our public cloud vendor with multiple high-bandwidth connections.  As Box has completed its service migration to the public cloud, we are working to reduce the number of these connections being used.  In connection with this effort, we migrated traffic off of two links that were serving as a connection between the cloud and our DNS infrastructure.  Due to a missing configuration, the DNS-specific route was not being propagated throughout the network as expected; as a result, when these two links were turned off, our cloud infrastructure temporarily lost access to our DNS infrastructure.  This caused our internal services to stop being able to perform DNS lookups between each other.  At 10:32AM PDT, these links were turned back on, which allowed us to restore the original configuration and remediate this issue. However, because our configuration pipelines were also impacted by this issue and unable to connect to our DNS infrastructure, these links had to be turned back on manually, which impacted our time to remediation.\n\n‌\n\nBox has been migrating to a public cloud platform over the course of 2022-2023 to improve overall performance and reliability. Our DNS infrastructure is one of the final components that will be migrated to be hosted in public cloud. This migration is expected to be completed in the coming quarter and will give our public cloud infrastructure the ability to have this DNS locally instead of relying on these connections.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improve change procedure for routing changes involving interim hybrid connectivity critical infrastructure.  This will provide extra oversight over changes of this type to minimize the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future.\n* Finish the migration of DNS infrastructure into public cloud.\n* Improve resilience of our configuration pipelines so that impact to production does not also impact these pipelines. \n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nOn October 2, 2023, between 09:50 am PDT and 10:27 am PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have had a degraded experience or difficulty accessing Public API, Downloads, Uploads, Login, and Sign. The issue occurred due to a change to one of our backend systems that created a bottleneck that impacted other internal services. We were able to resolve the issue by deploying more instances of the service experiencing the bottleneck. In addition, we are implementing improvements for enhanced control over the flow of traffic within our backend systems. We are also working to establish new alerts on the impacted processes that will decrease time to detect and mitigate similar issues if they occur in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nBox services are underpinned by a common service communication layer called “Service Mesh” providing Box’s services with the abilities to securely communicate and automatically adapt the scale of the services to traffic bursts. During this incident we observed that the Service Mesh layer did not behave as expected. Specifically, the impacted service did not auto-scale as planned and, as a result, the service became overwhelmed leading to the issue. A deeper analysis of the issue demonstrated that the existing Service Mesh configuration, while optimum for the on-premise deployments, was not optimized for the traffic profile experienced in the public cloud.\n\n‌\n\nWe have been working with the technology vendor for our Service Mesh implementation to tune the configuration according to the new environment and have been rolling out the changes incrementally. We have also increased the capacity on critical services while rolling out these changes to minimize reliance on auto-scaling during that period.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Configure limits for the number of retries within internal systems to improve performance during peak traffic times.\n* Implement additional back pressure “circuit breakers” within our backend systems to protect the system from overloading in the event that similar conditions occur in the future.\n* Improve error handling to better differentiate Service Mesh errors from application errors.\n* Improve monitoring measures to automatically detect, diagnose, and remediate such issues before customers are actually impacted.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting the Box marketing site \\([www.box.com](http://www.box.com)\\). We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 10:07am PDT and 10:33am PDT on September 22nd, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, the Box marketing site \\([www.box.com](http://www.box.com)\\) was inaccessible and users attempting to access the site encountered a 404 error page. The issue occurred as a result of instability in Box’s marketing site vendor’s network. We were able to resolve the issue by working with the vendor to deploy a temporary workaround to remediate this issue**.** In addition, we are working with the vendor to improve their rollout verification process and also to identify Box-owned processes to remediate similar issues should they arise in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe cause of this issue was a change in the leader election process of a key component in the vendor’s configuration management pipeline. This change triggered a race condition in a downstream component in the pipeline, which resulted in overwriting some customer configurations with an empty configuration. While the change was rolled out gradually with a canary process, the vendor’s automated rollout verification mechanism was not able to identify the issue. The issue was eventually detected by the vendor’s data plane monitoring systems, which alerted due to the rise in errors being served.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned by the vendor and Box:\n\n* Vendor: Identify and resolve the underlying race condition in configuration lifecycle that resulted in the unintended modifications.\n* Vendor: Improve tooling and processes to more quickly and safely rollback components in the configuration management system.\n* Vendor: Improve internal monitoring and visualization to better assess and understand source of error response alerting to expedite detection and remediation.\n* Box: Identify and implement Box-owned solution to remediate similar issues should they arise in the future.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Box Notes. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nOn Monday, Sept 18, 2023, between 07:26 AM PST and 07:33 AM PST, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have encountered errors while loading Box Notes documents. The issue occurred due to a slow leadership election in a coordination service. The issue resolved itself, due to health automation processes recreating the unhealthy service. In addition, we plan to adjust our health check automation to resolve similar issues more quickly should they occur again in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nBox Notes leverages multiple Apache Zookeeper ensembles to coordinate distributed compute services. Each ensemble is composed of a leader and several followers. When a leader fails, the remaining members quickly elect a new leader, who ensures that the other followers’ data is up to date, and continue running without issue, a process that usually takes less than a second and causes no impact.\n\nIn this incident, the leader failed, but the election of a new leader took an unusually long period of time, due to an unexpectedly large amount of data that needed to be synchronized. Due to the amount of time this election took, our health checks triggered an automated process that rebuilds unhealthy ensemble members, which disrupted the election process and further impacted the time taken for the election. Upon investigation, we determined that our health checks should have waited longer before deciding that corrective action was required.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Tune our health checks to be less aggressive in deciding when a resource needs to be recreated.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nOn September 12, 2023 between 5:50 PM PDT and 9:40 PM PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, customer email notifications including password reset or 2-factor authentication code emails may have been delayed. The issue occurred due to the loss of internet access in one Availability Zone during a scheduled firewall redeployment. We were able to resolve the issue by manually updating routing configuration on the affected instances. In addition, we are working on improving our per-instance health-checks so that they do not take any traffic until they are ready.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nDuring our investigation, the root cause of the incident was identified as a network routing misconfiguration that occurred during the scheduled deployment. This led to loss of internet access in one Availability Zone, thereby causing latencies in customer email notifications including password reset or 2-factor authentication code emails. We have enhanced our post deployment verification by adding a check to ensure that instances are serving traffic effectively. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Integrate network configuration setup in the image creation workflow instead of post-creation to establish consistency.\n* Enhance the existing monitoring setup with improved alerting features to expedite issue identification and resolution.\n* Optimize our per-instance health check to prevent instances from receiving traffic until they are fully prepared.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time, customers may have experienced transient failures in the Events API and delays in synchronizing files via Box Drive. The issue occurred because of a sudden surge in customer traffic that overloaded an isolated part of our infrastructure. The issue was resolved once the infrastructure automatically scaled up to handle the load.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred due to our services experiencing a sudden surge in traffic volume from Box Drive. This surge caused the services managing our user events API to run in a degraded state.

In addition, In addition, we are working to improve our testing and deployment processes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue was caused by a change in the configuration of the server fleet responsible for processing Box webapp traffic. The change was aimed at consolidating configurations such that further reliability and user experience improvements can be developed and deployed faster in the future. Unfortunately, the change inadvertently impacted embedded image rendering in Box Notes, which caused some customers to experience difficulty viewing images embedded in Box Notes. Additionally, the testing conducted as part of our standard deployment process did not address this specific facet of Box Notes, and as a result, this issue was not detected prior to deployment. Additionally, incident detection and mitigation took longer than normal because there was no alert configured to escalate in case of failed embedded image renders in Box Notes.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Implement automated testing for Box Notes embedded image rendering\n* Add alerts for Box Notes embedded image render failures\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, some Box users may have experienced increased errors or slowness when accessing [Box.com](http://Box.com), Uploads, Downloads, Public API, Logins and Box Sign.  The issue occurred due to a misconfiguration being applied during an upsize process on one of our database pods, which caused the database pod to become unhealthy when load increased during the issue.  We were able to resolve the issue by deploying the correct configuration.  In addition, we will be adding alerts to detect the misconfiguration so it can be fixed before causing impact.  \n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe database pod involved in this issue was manually upsized on August 3rd as a proactive measure in case of high load.  The upsize process used an incorrect command that misconfigured the pod such that it was not able to take advantage of the increased capacity during the issue.  During the period of time immediately after the upsize and before the issue, there was an opportunity to detect the misconfiguration and fix it before causing impact, but there is currently no alert in place for that detection.  \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Alert when a database pod’s runtime configurations are stale  \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, customers may have experienced delays when using Box Drive. We would like to take this opportunity to provide an analysis of this issue and the corrective actions we have taken in response.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe issue occurred due to one of our services experiencing a surge in users from Box Drive  This surge caused the service to run in a degraded state. At the root of this incident were capacity constraints that our existing servers could not adequately manage. We were able to resolve the issue by adding additional capacity to the service. Additionally, we have set up alerts designed to notify our on-call engineering team when server utilization approaches the set limits, allowing for immediate corrective action.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Capacity increase to ensure our servers can handle projected user traffic surges\n* Alerts to notify on-call engineering when servers are operating near its limit so corrective actions can be taken immediately\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time, some users may have experienced delays in Box Drive synchronizing changes.

In addition, we will be refining our auto-scaling tuning to ensure capacity is maintained throughout the duration to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.  \n\n**Analysis**\n\nBox has been internally migrating services to improve both latency and availability.

This resulted in additional latency during the recovery that may have been noticed by Box Drive users.  \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Migrate affected services to be co-located in a single region to minimize latency\n* Tune auto-scaler to ensure planned capacity is available during any future migrations\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Preview and Search. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 6:43am PT and 9:02am PT on August 16, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have experienced issues when loading document previews or searching for documents. The issue occurred as a result of database latency and load which had downstream impacts on other services. We were able to resolve the issue by by increasing duration limits for database calls from downstream services. In addition, we are working on ensuring these downstream services are more resilient in the case of database latency in order to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nStarting around 2:30am PT on August 16th, a DB pod started to run hot which caused latency to increase for calling services.  DB latency stayed high through the morning which, when combined with increased traffic, eventually lead to calling services being rate limited starting at 6:43am PT.  The rate limit errors increased until around 8:30am PT when DB latencies came down to normal levels.  Rate limits were draining slowly and it was decided to increase the rate limit for calling services to enable full recovery.  With rate limits increased, full recovery happened at 9:02am PT.  \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improve resiliency of calling services in cases of DB latency.\n* Improve visibility into calling services in cases of increased traffic.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time users may have been unable to view or edit File Request settings, to create new File Request links, or to view the File Request view page. The issue occurred as a result of a recent configuration adjustment made to enhance service availability and reliability. We were able to resolve the issue by augmenting resources to the impacted workloads. In addition, we are instituting regular capacity audits and reassessing the setup of analogous services to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nOur investigations pinpointed the issue to our service migration to a new environment. An unintended under-provisioning in server deployment occurred, influenced by the specific environment and the scaling tools in use. This provisioning discrepancy rendered the service vulnerable to traffic spikes. With existing scaling metric challenges, this led to resource depletion and subsequent service disruptions.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Conduct a thorough capacity review for all recently migrated services.\n* Proactively increase resource allocation for similar services.\n* Refine our scaling strategies to better accommodate traffic fluctuations.\n* Augment our alerting and monitoring systems for quicker issue detection and resolution.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, users may have experienced a “Reconnecting” or “Trying to reconnect” error while being blocked from making edits to Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. The issue occurred as a result of a latent bug, arising out of a recent infrastructure change in our ongoing effort to improve performance and stability, that impaired the request validation exchange between Box and Google . We were able to resolve the issue by repairing the validation exchange with Google in order to successfully validate editor requests. In addition, we are working to improve our early detection and testing process to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.   \n\n**Analysis** \n\nDuring infrastructure change testing, the team did not detect this issue through logging or monitoring. \n\nThe root cause and fix were identified quickly, however there were various temporary infrastructure issues that prevented quick remediation.  \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* E2E testing of Google Workspace integration prior to any major change.  \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Public API, Downloads, Uploads and Sign. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn July 26, 2023 between 5:30 and 6:20 PM PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have degraded experience or difficulty accessing Public API, Downloads, Uploads and Sign. The issue occurred due to an outage of an internal secrets management system that failed after a rare spike in requests from other systems. We were able to resolve the issue by restarting the front ends of the secrets management system to shed connections. In addition, we scaled up the capacity for the secrets management system as well as modified internal clients to reduce the magnitude of future spikes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe internal secrets management system’s file descriptor and connection limits had been increased two months before this issue occurred. The increases were intended to improve system performance during anomalous conditions, but the system’s TCP ephemeral port range remained too small. A request spike consumed the available ephemeral ports on the hosts, resulting in the system becoming unavailable.  \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Tuned the system’s limits to prevent the port exhaustion condition from reoccurring\n* Improvements made to reduce the recurrence of high magnitude request spikes\n* The connection limiting front end is being replaced with an improved load balancer\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",
