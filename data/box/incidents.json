To the best of our knowledge, this is the current state and we may update as more information is confirmed._ \n\n \n\nBetween 9:42 PM PT on August 12, 2025 and 3:44 AM PT on August 13, 2025, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have experienced issues or timeouts when using Box AI in Preview, Notes and Hubs. The issue occurred due to networking changes to one of our Cloud service providers. We were able to resolve the issue by temporarily switching traffic to an alternate provider. In addition, we are partnering with our cloud service provider to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\nWe are conducting a full engineering postmortem and our overview is subject to change with further analysis and findings. In the event our continuing investigation yields further substantive findings, we may publish additional analysis after the conclusion of the full engineering postmortem.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, one of our database clusters experienced unexpected partial functionality degradation in Notes and Sign for a subset of users. We subsequently identified a latent configuration error that led to this database cluster entering a read-only state and as a result, automated remediation procedures were not triggered. We were able to resolve the issue by manually transitioning the database cluster into a writable state and updating the configuration for our database remediation service to work as expected. In addition, we are improving alerting and auditing our deployment procedures to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\nWe are conducting a full engineering postmortem and our overview is subject to change with further analysis and findings. In the event our continuing investigation yields further substantive findings, we may publish additional analysis after the conclusion of the full engineering postmortem.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently experienced issues affecting customers’ access to their files, including uploads, downloads, preview and Box Notes. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to improve our resilience in the future.\n\nBetween 10:50 AM and 1:10 PM PT on June 12th, 2025, users experienced difficulties while working in Box. While customers were able to log in and browse their account during this time, features that deal directly with file content, such as uploads, downloads and preview, were unavailable. This was due to a global outage affecting critical third-party cloud services on which Box relies.\n\n‌\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe following is a high-level timeline of the incident:\n\n* 10:50 am: The cloud services in question suffered a worldwide outage rendering file content owned by our customers inaccessible. Incident response commences both at Box and within affected cloud service provider organizations.\n* 12:30 pm: Third party cloud services are partially recovered, and service becomes available in some regions.\n* 1:10 pm: Box engineers complete regional failover of file content traffic into a region where cloud service has been recovered. Box customer impact is mitigated at this point.\n* 2:23 pm: Cloud services are fully recovered.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis**\n\nBox systems are designed to be resilient to outages and degradations in our cloud environment. In particular, we design our systems to handle zonal and single-region cloud service incidents with minimal impact to our customers. Unfortunately, this incident was caused by a global cloud service provider issue that caused service to remain offline across all cloud regions for a prolonged period of time. Box architects our systems to be resilient to a wide variety of incidents with minimal impact to customers. Given that this incident was exceedingly rare and global, the impact to our systems was more prolonged.\n\nHowever, our prompt reaction to the incident reduced impact for Box customers by 73 minutes relative to the total length of outage suffered by our cloud service provider. That said, we take every incident as a learning opportunity and have surfaced additional improvements we can make to our systems and procedures.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Box’s communications with underlying cloud service providers will be improved for more rapid incident resolution. In this case, cloud services were recovered in a region, but we were not immediately alerted so it took some time for Box engineers to discover this and route traffic to it. We are working to improve our joint incident response protocols with third party cloud service providers to address this.\n* As part of our analysis on this incident, we discovered opportunities for deeper third party integrations that will enable us to further improve our automatic recovery in the unlikely event that such an event occurs again. This will lessen our dependence on direct communication with vendors.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.\n\nSincerely,    \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Box and would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 02:18 PM PT and 02:49 PM PT on May 21, 2025, users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, Box services and APIs were temporarily unavailable. This was caused by a middleware service that was unable to discover our databases due to a change made in the tooling used to manage our database fleet. We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back the problematic change.  In addition, we are improving our database management tool’s observability and rollout process to proactively detect and prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nAs part of our routine patching process, we upgraded the tooling used to manage our database fleet. This upgrade was performed before certain prerequisite upgrades on a subset of critical databases. As a result, the updated tooling was incompatible with those databases, causing our middleware service to fail to discover them, leading to a service outage.\n\nThe incident highlighted gaps in our database management tool’s upgrade sequencing, rollout validation, and rollback readiness as well as gaps in system observability needed for early detection and remediation of partial discovery failures, all areas we are actively addressing.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Improve patching upgrade rollout validation\n* Optimize our database management tool’s rollback procedures for faster recovery\n* Enhance system observability for early detection and remediation of partial discovery failures\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and share the steps we have taken to prevent future occurrences.\n\n‌\n\nBetween 5:00 PM PT and 6:30 PM PT on May 19, 2025, users may have experienced difficulties while using Box AI.  During this time, many users experienced errors when trying to make queries on Box AI and were unable to receive query results. Other users experienced unusually high latencies in responses during this period. The disruption was caused by a bug in a code change deployed to one of our Box AI services. We quickly identified the problem and resolved it by rolling back the faulty release. The underlying issue has since been fixed. Additionally, we have increased testing coverage and plan to implement more latency monitoring to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis**\n\nAt Box, we are always striving to improve the resilience of our services. The AI team implemented a code change intended to support automatic fallbacks for large language model \\(LLM\\) providers during outages. A bug in this change temporarily resulted in AI query failures, which we were able to resolve by rolling back the faulty release. This incident highlighted gaps in our latency monitoring systems and internal integration test coverage. We are committed to improving these areas to enhance system resilience and reliability.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Enhancing latency monitoring to detect issues earlier\n* Making our unit testing process stronger before releasing updates \n* Strengthening our integration tests to catch this class of issues before it goes out\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n‌\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween May 15, 2025 12:19 AM PDT and May 16, 2025 5:45 AM PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while signing up for Box. During this time, some users were presented with a message incorrectly indicating a payment processing issue during the signup process. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change to update error messages. We were able to resolve the issue by updating the message and removing the one that incorrectly identified the issue as being related to payment. Additionally, we’re improving our planning and testing strategies to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.  \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe signup issues occurred as a result of new security measures adopted to better protect our users and prevent misuse. The new security measures included changes to our error messaging. Some of the error messages shown during free user signups inadvertently included incorrect wording after this change resulting in some confusion. We have now updated these messages to be clearer and more accurate based on the customer signup flow.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Ensuring error messages are customized and correct for different user segments to prevent confusion.\n* Maintaining close collaboration between engineering, product, and customer support teams to quickly identify and address any user-facing issues arising from backend changes.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nOn May 7, 2025 between 01:21 AM and 01:00 PM PT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box, particularly when interacting with Box services. The issue occurred due to a code change that inadvertently increased the memory requirements in our database backend for certain queries. This issue triggered automated remediation tooling, however, it was unable to keep up with the consistently increasing load. This resulted in degraded availability for some of our services that perform write operations for a small subset of users. We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back the change once it was identified. We have implemented enhanced monitoring to quickly catch and mitigate similar issues in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\n‌\n\nThe Search Team is actively working to reduce overall quicksearch latency for customers. Quicksearch is a fast search request executed in the Box Web Application by typing a query term \\(without pressing Enter to continue to FullSearch\\). As part of these efforts, the team implemented validation logic that inadvertently issued a large number of parallel queries against our databases, causing them to experience memory exhaustion. This issue was not caught in testing due to differences in our production data compared to test data. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Creating test datasets that reflect production data distribution.\n* Enforcing configuration of bounded execution pools for asynchronous processing, preventing future uncontrolled surges and improving system resilience.\n* Conducting a round of rollback exercises using standardized pipelines while ensuring rollback links are centrally accessible and reliable.\n* Improving logging and monitoring on database nodes and critical dependency traffic, to enable earlier detection of abnormal load patterns.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

The root cause was identified as suboptimal resource allocation within the shared compute environment that powers Relay workflow executions.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n1. Enhancement of internal tools to rebalance resource allocation.\n2. Planned architectural improvements to isolate high-volume customer activity and protect overall system performance. \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience possible. We hope this has provided some clarity, and we are happy to answer any further questions you may have.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting the Box Webapp and Public API. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 4:29 PM PDT and 7:14 PM PDT on April 13, 2025, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have experienced slowness or occasional errors when interacting with some features in the Box webapp or public API, including Logins, Uploads/Downloads, and Notes. The issue occurred as a result of CPU performance degradation in multiple instances of our relational data access service in a single availability zone. We were able to resolve the issue by performing a rolling restart of the affected instances. In addition, we are working to improve our remediation processes when a single availability zone is affected in order to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nDuring the time of the incident, we detected that several instances of our relational data access service in a single availability zone were experiencing higher-than-expected latencies. Because Box webapp and public API requests depend on this relational data access service, this additional latency impacted the Box webapp and public API. We resolved the issue by performing a rolling restart of the affected instances. However, the rolling restart took longer than desired and impacted latencies for the duration of the rolling restart. We identified corrective actions to more quickly remediate a similar issue in the future by leveraging tooling to divert traffic away from an impacted availability zone.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Improve observability into issues that affect a single availability zone\n* Improve processes around usage of tooling to safely and quickly divert traffic away from an impacted availability zone\n* Decrease time to perform restart of relational data access service instances\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 9:04am and 10:32am PDT on March 21, 2025, some Box Zones users in Germany and France may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some servers became unresponsive, causing connections to time out for some users in these Box Zones regions. The issue occurred due to a configuration change made as part of a software upgrade, which resulted in some servers losing memory. We were able to resolve the issue by temporarily redirecting some processing activity until the configuration change was fixed. Throughout the duration of the incident, all content continued to be stored in the correct Zones region. We are also implementing additional monitoring and alerting to catch this type of issue sooner to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred due to a configuration change which was made as part of upgrading some software to use the latest Long Term Supported \\(LTS\\) version of Java. The change inadvertently resulted in some servers running out of Java heap memory. We were able to resolve the issue by temporarily processing some European customer traffic using servers in the US until the European servers were back to normal. At no time during the issue was content moved or stored in a different region than the appropriate Box Zones region.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Additional monitoring and alerting is being put into place to catch this type of issue sooner to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n* We are making improvements to reduce the amount of time taken to switch to alternative servers for processing in these and similar issues. \n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting several features across Box, including Logins, Uploads/Downloads, and Notes. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween between 3:06 AM and 4:35 AM PDT on March 19, 2025, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have experienced slowness or occasional errors when interacting with several major features in the Box platform. The issue occurred due to a latent issue that inadvertently caused several caching instances to restart in an unhealthy state while serving traffic. We were able to resolve the issue by temporarily routing traffic away from impacted caching instances until they were manually restored by on-call engineers. In addition, we addressed the underlying code issue that triggered the server restarts and will provide additional controls to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nAt 3:05 AM PDT, the service responsible for management of our caching clusters became unreachable due a latent code bug in its leader election process. Health checks on individual caching VMs misinterpreted the connectivity issue to this central service as a problem with the caching instances themselves. This incorrectly prompted them to restart in an attempt to remediate the issue but instead prompted them to reject live traffic. The upstream data access service, which depends on these caches, in turn was forced to route additional traffic to our databases, resulting in increased latency and potential timeouts.\n\nIn this case, the impacted caching instances were contained to a single GCP availability zone. We eventually remediated this issue by using newly-developed tooling to divert all Box traffic from the degraded zone until the affected caching instances were manually restored by on-call engineers. However, this went unnoticed during the initial investigation as engineers pursued remediating the problems within the caching tier, which increased time to remediation.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Changing the underlying behavior that led to improperly triggering VM recreation and adding additional controls to ensure successful initialization.\n* Implementing changes to ensure that leader election for this management service guarantees that a healthy server is discoverable.\n* Adding observability to diagnose failures contained to a single AZ and improve processes to more quickly employ a zonal drain.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps taken to keep them from happening again.\n\nBetween 01:39 AM PT and 05:19 AM PT on March 12, 2025, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, Box customers were unable to open or edit Microsoft Office files via Office Online. The issue occurred as a result of network connectivity issues with Microsoft's services. We were able to resolve the issue by restoring the network connectivity with our partner. In addition, we are working on making the Box For Office Integration more resilient to prevent similar problems in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe Box For Office Integration enhances communication with Microsoft servers, enabling Office Online functionalities for files hosted in Box. This communication occurs through the Web Application Open Platform Interface \\(WOPI\\) protocol. Most WOPI operations require a process called WOPI discovery. During this phase, a WOPI host \\(like Box\\), identifies how to perform specific actions within the WOPI protocol. In this case, it is performed by retrieving a discovery XML file from Microsoft's Discovery Endpoint. This file contains essential information about the URLs needed for these actions and the keys required for validating signatures on each WOPI command. The file is then cached for a set period. \n\nBefore the outage that caused this issue, one of the discovery endpoints in Office Online faced significant slowdowns and longer response times than usual. At the same time, Box's cache expired, which prevented us from managing WOPI operations effectively. As a result, users may have experienced session terminations and disruption of the integration between the two services. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* The cache time-to-live for the discovery file will be increased to minimize Box's exposure to potential failures in reaching the discovery endpoint.\n* The discovery file will be periodically refreshed by a dedicated process. This approach aims to offload the operational endpoint, thereby minimizing its exposure to potential issues during periods of degradation.\n* The operations timeout will be reduced to enhance overall performance.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 1:48 AM PT and 2:25 AM PT on March 3, 2025, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. Additionally, starting at 8:44 PM PT that same day, some users may have once again encountered issues. The disruption ended before 9:59 PM PST.  During these time periods, a subset of users experienced slowness and intermittent errors with Notes, Public API, logins and uploads/downloads. The issue occurred as a result of a fragmented system table on a database cluster which ultimately led to the database crashing. The first instance was caused by increased traffic while the second occurred due to our manual remediation process putting additional load on the database. Our database remediation service attempted to resolve the issue both times but was unsuccessful due to the thread\\_cache\\_size setting being set too low. We were able to address the short-term problem by manually redirecting traffic to a healthy database node. To maintain medium-term stability of the database, the team rebuilt the cluster to eliminate the fragmented table. Additionally, we will be splitting the database cluster into smaller databases to prevent future overloads and improving our database remediation service to better handle this type of case.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe database cluster at issue experienced gradual performance degradation before the issue became apparent. This degradation was caused by the growing fragmented system table due to increasing database size and traffic. However, this degradation went unnoticed because the existing alerting system did not flag any problems.\n\nIn addition, the auto-remediation system was unsuccessful because it hit a case where two database configurations were incompatible. Specifically, the max\\_connections setting was increased without adjusting the thread\\_cache\\_size, resulting in frequent thread cache misses and preventing the failover procedure from having the resources needed to succeed.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Rebuilding the database cluster to eliminate the table fragmentation and prevent medium-term performance degradation \n* Adding metrics and alerting for table fragmentation to proactively monitor issues \n* Adjusting database configurations such that thread\\_cache\\_size dynamically adjusts with the max\\_connections database configuration settings\n* Improving the database remediation process by adjusting timeouts to accommodate large database clusters\n* Accelerating the database split process to quickly divide large clusters, reducing traffic overload and improving routine maintenance success\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Box public APIs, Shared Links and Box Notes. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 11:18 AM and 12:15 PM PST on Feb 19th, 2025, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this period, there was a noticeable degradation in the following services: Public API, Login, Box Sign, Shared Links, and Notes.  Due to a gap in the procedure related to the management of application authentication keys, this led to a deletion of keysets that were mistakenly believed to be no longer necessary.  The impact of this was detected through a drop in Box’s User Availability metrics at 11:15am PST and by 11:52am PST. This drop was traced to the operation of the deletion of these keys. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe deleted key is important for token-based authentication between the application and the database which stores security rules to validate Box upstream services.  The deletion of this key caused the authentication failure of the application with the database and prohibited the application from executing properly.  Additionally, after reviewing our protocol around customer awareness of issues, we realize that our timeliness goal for posting to our Status site was not met.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Migrate application authorization to a centralized authentication process / service.\n* Limit visibility of application account key read/write access on the administrator console.\n* Update necessary runbooks with correct procedures.\n* Review and streamline Status posting events to ensure timely and consistent communication.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Box services. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, between 5:00 PM PST and 7:00 PM PST, Box conducted a planned zonal resilience test as part of ongoing efforts to enhance system reliability. During the test, all traffic from one active service zone was diverted to other healthy zones. As a result, some users may have experienced slowness, login failures, or other difficulties while using Box. The impact lasted until 7:04 PM PST, extending four minutes beyond the planned maintenance window. During the test, some backend services experienced temporary overloading, making the impact more severe than anticipated. We mitigated the issue by redistributing traffic across all active zones.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nDuring a planned zonal resilience test, all traffic from one active service zone was diverted to other zones. However, one zone unexpectedly experienced a disproportionate increase in traffic compared to the others. While the backend services in that zone generally had enough capacity to handle the load, a cache instance became overloaded due to a key that was accessed significantly more than others. This overload triggered a ripple effect, impacting database health, which in turn caused requests to pile up at the Edge layer, ultimately leading to request rejections. During the test, we successfully identified and root-caused the issue, mitigating it by ending the test and redistributing traffic more evenly across all active zones.\n\nThe issue revealed the following areas of improvements:\n\n* Insufficient monitoring for single-instance failures during resilience testing.\n* Uneven traffic distribution among zones, leading to localized overload.\n* Lack of mechanisms to detect and prevent key issues from overloading cache instances.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Enhancing zonal resilience mechanics to ensure more balanced traffic distribution during a zonal failure.\n* Improving monitoring to detect single-instance failures more effectively during resilience testing.\n* Optimizing cache access patterns to prevent key issues from overloading cache instances.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time, some of the load balancers taking customer traffic suffered from memory exhaustion leading to users experiencing intermittent issues logging in to Box and connecting to the Box Webapp. The issue occurred due to a latent memory exhaustion problem in some of our public load balancer instances and was exacerbated by peak traffic levels. We were able to resolve the issue by performing a rolling restart of the affected instances and increasing the available load balancer instances to support peak traffic levels. In addition, we are working on improving our observability into the latent memory issues and previously unknown signals on these systems to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nStarting at 5:30am PST on January 15th, some external load balancer instances which are responsible for routing all customer traffic started to exhaust their shared memory allocation. This happened due to organic traffic growth and an increase in the number of backends to which the load balancers were proxying traffic. While the overall memory of these systems remained at an acceptable level throughout the incident window, the shared memory zone was not tracked as a separate metric; as a result, the team was not alerted to this resource exhaustion. As the day went on and traffic levels increased, at 3:52pm PST these instances started to experience intermittent problems passing traffic to their backends, which led to customers experiencing intermittent errors or slowdowns when accessing Box, \\(including logins as well as the Webapp\\). Once the problem was identified during the investigation, we performed a rolling restart of the affected load balancer instances and increased the number of available instances. As a result of these efforts, overall site health was immediately improved and was considered recovered at 5:10pm PST.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Improving our tracking and alerting on shared memory zone utilization \\[DONE\\]\n* Improving external test coverage as well as internal SLO baselines\n* Automating process for rolling reloads or restarts across the load balancing fleet\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, some customers might have experienced issues loading Admin Console. The issue occurred due to mismatch in React framework versions on different Box applications. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the code change. In addition, we are updating our monitoring dashboards to include more alerts for such an edge case to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\nWe are conducting a full engineering postmortem and our overview is subject to change with further analysis and findings. In the event our continuing investigation yields further substantive findings, we may publish additional analysis after the conclusion of the full engineering postmortem.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back this change**.** In addition, we are working to improve our testing processes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\n‌\n\nWe are working on refactoring and modernizing the Box Embed codebase. As part of this process we released updated code to a small percentage of client enterprises. After the release, it was discovered that some components of our Salesforce Integration \\(Box Lightning Components\\) and an older version of our Oracle NetSuite Integration \\(V1\\) were using endpoints that were not compatible with this update. Given that the code was only released to a subset of users and only some of them were using these specific integrations, it took some time before the issue could be detected and resolved.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Working on improved monitoring for the services affected.\n* Working on updates to legacy endpoints affected by the code change.\n* Improved testing procedures for Box Embed releases and the services affected.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, users may have experienced difficulties in performing login operations and file uploads/downloads. This issue occurred as a result of a recent software change in our ongoing effort to improve performance and stability. We were able to resolve the issue by increasing the scaling of a feature toggle management service. In addition, we are working to improve our release strategy to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nBefore the incident, we had identified an issue with autoscaling of our feature toggle management service and prepared a change in four major applications. The change was inadvertently pushed simultaneously across all regions and instances. The simultaneous restarts of the applications caused a temporary slowdown in the affected applications ability to process all of the load in a timely manner resulting increased timeout errors across Box’s products.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Adjust release strategy for feature toggle management service to ensure a more gradual rollout\n* Investigate platform configuration to decrease application start-up time during release rollouts\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 5 September 2024 02:33 and 7 September 2024 01:31 PST, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, Box Drive & Box Sync were slow in recognizing that documents had been updated by other users and a new copy was needed. The issue occurred because a new software release introduced unexpected latency in a processing pipeline used in propagating update notifications. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the software update, fixing the problem and redeploying. In addition, we have improved our monitoring processes and implemented new monitors to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nStarting 5 September 2024 02:00 \\(PST\\) a software component was deployed that was not properly configured with enough threads.  As a result, throughput of a processing pipeline started to slow and a queue of requests started to build.  The queue was noticed and the responsible component reverted by 6 Sept 2024 12:00 \\(PST\\), but it took until 7 Sept 2024 01:31 \\(PST\\) for the backlog of requests to clear.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Implement monitors on notification queue size\n* Implement throughput monitors on downstream components\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn Thursday, August 29, 2024, between 1:48am and 3:38am PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some Box KeySafe customers experienced difficulty uploading new content to Box, as well as downloading content. Additionally, some customers encountered issues with Microsoft office co-authoring feature. The incident began due to a network connectivity issue within our cloud vendor that impacted Identity and Access Management \\(IAM\\) and access to Key Management Service \\(KMS\\). This caused a backup in requests to some of the Box services involved with Microsoft Co-Authoring. We were able to resolve the issue once normal operation with our cloud vendor was restored. In addition to implementing the recommended customer actions from the vendor-provided RCA, we're also working to enhance the resiliency of our system in related areas and improve visibility through health checks to detect and prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nA cloud vendor network incident disrupted Box's communication with Key Management Service \\(KMS\\) instances, affecting upload and download operations for KeySafe customers. This triggered a cascading effect, as requests accumulated on a backend service involved in Microsoft Office co-authoring. The increased workload on this service's Istio-proxy container led to memory and CPU spikes, causing DNS resolution errors and latency issues. These problems further hampered Microsoft Office co-authoring requests, creating a cycle of retries and failures.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Using regional STS endpoints as recommended by our cloud vendor’s RCA of this issue.\n* Implementing additional health checks for the impacted backend service.\n* Enhancing connection handling of the impacted backed service to prevent excessive queueing.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time, users would have seen an error banner indicating that the system was reconnecting and, upon reconnecting, some of the users’ recent edits may have been reverted. The issue occurred as a result of a code change enabling values to be written to cache on the Notes servers unintentionally. We were able to resolve the issue by disabling the code that the change was applied to and updating it to no longer write to cache. In addition, we are working to improve the resiliency of our system in the related areas as well as gain higher visibility through logging to detect and prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred because a process that reads values from the Notes database and caches them in memory on the Notes server was unintentionally enabled on servers not taking live traffic \\(passive\\). Meanwhile, servers taking live traffic \\(active\\) were allowed to make updates to those values in the Notes database. However, the values in cache on the passive servers were not updated or cleared. When traffic was redirected to the passive servers, those stale values were returned from cache causing a mismatch in what was returned by the server and what was expected by clients. Clients attempted to send updates to the servers to correct the mismatch, but a bug in the client caused the updates to be invalid and rejected by the servers. This resulted in an error banner being shown and the client being unable to recover from the mismatch.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Update code to prevent process from running on passive servers\n* Update code to clear values from cache when servers transition from passive to active\n* Fix client bug causing invalid updates to be sent to server\n* Add logging to detect when values are returned from cache unintentionally\n* Improve developer documentation to prevent similar changes from being made in the future\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, users may have encountered issues uploading and downloading files as well as retrieving results from our events API. The issue occurred as a result of an unexpected upstream failure in our database infrastructure that did not recover automatically. We were able to resolve the issue by manually triggering a failover operation of the impacted database and verifying successful completion of transactions after failover.

We are constantly testing our automated failover processes and working to improve any shortcomings as they are identified to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred due to a failure in our database remediation service using a suboptimal upstream API to recreate failed database nodes under certain conditions.  In order to ensure data integrity, our database remediation service paused further actions and escalated to our team to review the issue, at which point our engineers validated that a manual failover operation was the correct operation to restore service.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 12:13 AM and 2:55 AM PDT on June 14, 2024 and between 8:04 AM and 10:44 AM PDT on June 17, 2024, some users may have experienced slow or failed Search queries while working in Box. The issue occurred due to a change in a query pattern coming into the system that caused increased load on the search backend. We were able to resolve the issue by adding additional capacity to the search backends. In addition, we are working on updating our resource allocation to prevent load on a few search backend nodes from affecting other nodes.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOn June 14, some search nodes received a change in a query pattern that caused high load. This led to increased query latency and query failures, which eventually impacted users of Search. We were able to add more query nodes to handle the higher load. On June 17, the query pattern re-occurred with increased volume. In the second occurrence, we were able to again address the increased volume with additional capacity. We are reconfiguring resource allocation in the search backend nodes to better handle changes to query patterns. In addition, we’re working on solutions to prevent added load on a few nodes from cascading.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Increase resources/right size clusters\n* Optimize resource utilization to better handle the new query pattern\n* Isolate search nodes to ensure better quality of service to all users\n* Decrease the amount of time it takes to add new resources\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

The issue occurred due to a change in a query pattern coming into the system that caused increased load on the search backend. We were able to resolve the issue by adding additional capacity to the search backends. In addition, we are working on updating our resource allocation to prevent load on a few search backend nodes from affecting other nodes.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOn June 14, some search nodes received a change in a query pattern that caused high load. This led to increased query latency and query failures, which eventually impacted users of Search. We were able to add more query nodes to handle the higher load. On June 17, the query pattern re-occurred with increased volume. In the second occurrence, we were able to again address the increased volume with additional capacity. We are reconfiguring resource allocation in the search backend nodes to better handle changes to query patterns. In addition, we’re working on solutions to prevent added load on a few nodes from cascading.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Increase resources/right size clusters\n* Optimize resource utilization to better handle the new query pattern\n* Isolate search nodes to ensure better quality of service to all users\n* Decrease the amount of time it takes to add new resources\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "_We recently addressed issues affecting Search. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future._\n\n \n\n_Between 9:33 pm PDT on June 3, 2024 and 1:28 pm PDT on June 4, 2024 and between 6:38 pm PDT and 7:52 pm PDT on June 6, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users were intermittently unable to query Search or receive Search results. This issue impacted a very small number \\(approximately 2%\\) of enterprises. During the first period, the issue occurred as a result of a partially rolled out recent code change. This code change was part of our ongoing effort to improve performance and stability. During the second period, the issue occurred a result of a latent bug in the Search Shadow service, which was used to investigate the root cause of the initial issue. We were able to resolve the issue by fully rolling back the change in both cases. In addition, we have added alerting to detect partial rollouts of changes as well as tests in pre-production environments and addressed the latent bug in the Search Shadow service to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future._ \n\n‌\n\n_Analysis_ \n\n_On June 3, 2024, Search released a change to how backend Search nodes are queried in order to improve performance and stability. This change had an unintended effect on query patterns that dramatically increased load for a small number of queries and only manifested at scale. Although the number of such queries was small, when a backend Search node processed them it would sporadically run out of memory and impact all traffic to that particular node. The Search release mechanism partially rolled out this change to a fraction of the fleet, but did not progress further. We initiated standard rollback procedures, but we did not detect that the change remained deployed on one of the nodes. This complicated the processes of diagnosing and mitigating the impact. The issue was mitigated when the partial rollback was detected and the change was fully rolled back._\n\n‌\n\n_On June 6, 2024, as part of the investigation to identify and verify the root cause of the initial issue, the Search team utilized a so-called Shadow service in production that does not service live traffic.  However, this Shadow service contained a latent bug that allowed a small percent of queries to be issued against the live backend Search nodes. Because the issue that occurred on June 3, 2024 could be triggered with just a handful of queries, the live serving nodes were inadvertently impacted by this Shadow service. The Shadow service change was rolled back to mitigate._\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n_Corrective Actions_\n\n_The following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:_\n\n* _Improve release mechanisms and procedures to fully rollout or rollback changes in a bounded period of time_\n* _Add tooling and alerting to determine whether a change is fully or only partially deployed_\n* _Add additional tests to pre-production environments to detect unintended Search query pattern changes that sporadically increase load on backend Search nodes_\n* _Fix latent bug in Shadow service and add additional monitoring to detect queries being routed incorrectly to live backend Search nodes_\n\n‌\n\n_We are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter._ \n\n \n\n_Sincerely,_\n\n_The Box Team_",

Over the course of this period, there were several 60-90 second time intervals when logins and various other functionality was impaired. This issue occurred due to a recent change in our token rotation process as part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the security of our systems. We resolved the problem by overriding the process and updating the expired tokens. Additionally, we are actively working on improving our testing procedures to prevent similar issues from happening again in the future.\n\n‌\n\nWe are conducting a full engineering postmortem and our overview is subject to change with further analysis and findings. In the event our continuing investigation yields further substantive findings, we may publish additional analysis after the conclusion of the full engineering postmortem.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 10:00 PM PST and 10:23 PM PST on April 24, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some Box customers might have experienced elevated error rate or increased latency with Box API requests. The issue occurred due to an unexpected failure during a MySQL Instance failover that was executed in response to high load on one of the database instances. We were able to resolve the issue by manually executing the instance failover. In addition, we have implemented a new discovery mechanism that improves the time to detect and propagate a MySQL topology change to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nDuring the incident, a failover was executed for a MySQL leader that had high CPU usage. The failover process failed to propagate the topology change and caused the impact to Box API success rate. The issue was remediated by executing the rest of the failover steps manually and the impact recovered once the new topology was successfully propagated to other components. The root cause of high CPU usage was later determined to be organic increase in week over week traffic and the impacted instance was upsized to add more CPU cores.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* The Database instance that had high CPU Usage was scaled up to add more CPU cores\n* Additionally, we are looking into remapping the Database instances to normalize the load on the impacted instance.\n* A MySQL Topology Discovery mechanism that significantly improves time to detect and propagate topology updates has been rolled out. This new mechanism improves mean time to recovery \\(MTTR\\) for similar issues in the future.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, some users might have not been able to access Box Notes. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change in our ongoing effort to improve user experience and stability of our application. We were able to resolve the issue by releasing a missing configuration value in production. In addition, we are working to improve our safety and efficiency of our release process to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\n‌\n\nThe code change responsible for the issue in object was caused by a missing configuration value in production settings. As a result, all instances of Notes using the new version image were unable to open and experienced downtime.\n\n‌\n\nDuring this incident, we identified certain gaps that contributed to this issue or resulted in longer-than-normal remediation, all of which we are working to address. First, this issue exposed a gap in our validation process for production configurations either before deployment or during server startup. Additionally, this issue did not trigger any alerts and was not visible through tracked metrics like SLO and UA graphs, which resulted in a lack of visibility of this issue. Finally, the deployment process for Notes servers does not allow for immediate rollbacks due to statefulset rollout taking approximately 45 minutes to complete, and our current incremental deployment process leaves us without a fully safe data center option as fallback.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Implementing production setting configuration safety improvements to reduce the likelihood of similar issues occurring again in the future.\n* Creating alerts on client-side JS errors to improve alerting and visibility of such issues.\n* Improving Notes incremental release safety to improve our deployment processes and facilitate more effective remediation of issues with deployments.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 2:41 AM and 2:51 PM PDT on March 26, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box Sign. During this time, the users were unable to send manual reminders for pending Sign requests, and delete sign requests in the WebApp. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred as a result of a recent code change made to improve Box Sign functionality. The issue presented itself in the sign mechanism for request handling, resulting in the sign reminder and delete functionalities not being available to the users. Incomplete automated testing coverage and pre-release checks for the functionalities mentioned above allowed the issue to go undetected before production deployment. We were able to quickly resolve the issue by performing a rollback of the sign web service. In addition, we are working on improving our monitoring system, pre-release quality check procedures, engineering on-call documentation and the robustness of the sign request handling mechanism to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Enhancing monitoring and alerts graphs in the sign service\n* Increasing the integration test coverage of the area affected in the incident \\(and adjacent ones\\)\n* Updating the sign engineering on-call documentation, as part of the effort to facilitate the improvement of detection and resolution time\n* Improving the robustness of the sign request handling mechanism\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween March 7, 2024 5:00 PM PT and March 8, 2024 3:00 AM PT, some users may have experienced difficulties while using Box AI in Box Notes and Preview. During this time, queries made to Box AI returned an error. The issue occurred due to a change to a load balancing configuration for one of our endpoints used for Box AI, which resulted in unexpected credential issues. We were able to resolve the issue by fixing the configuration and improving the resiliency of our system. In addition, we have increased alerting and implemented more monitoring and logging to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nAt Box, we are always striving to improve the efficiency and fault tolerance of our services. The AI team implemented a change to resolve latency issues in our services. A misconfiguration in this change temporarily resulted in AI query failures, which we were able to resolve by identifying and addressing the problematic configuration settings. Additionally, the issue revealed some gaps in our alerting and testing systems, as well as gaps in our internal team process, both of which impacted remediation time.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Add in more alerting and automated processes to prevent future complications\n* Improve observability by adding in more logs, metrics and tracing throughout the system.\n* Improve testing reliability by making testing environments mirror production environments.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 1:00PM PT and 1:40PM PT on March 7, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users were not able to access files stored in Box folders. The issue occurred as a result of a deployment of a data access service in our ongoing effort to improve the scalability of Box’s infrastructure. While deploying this service, a central control plane component became overloaded and was unable to propagate new data access instance information to the applications. We were able to resolve the issue by scaling up the control plane component. In addition, we are working to over-provision the control plane component and improve the monitoring and alerting to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nBox utilizes a communication layer called \"Service Mesh\" to facilitate effective communication between its services. However, a recent increase in the number of applications onboarded to Service Mesh caused the control plane component to become overloaded, resulting in delays propagating instance changes for impacted services. Before the incident occurred, several core applications underwent deployment simultaneously, including the Data Access Service. Unfortunately, the control plane failed to promptly propagate instance changes for this service. Since most user interactions with Box rely on connecting with the Data Access Service, users were unable to access files stored in Box folders during this time due to the propagation delay.\n\n‌\n\nTo address this issue and prevent future occurrences of control plane overload, we have scaled up its capacity by three times and implemented improved monitoring and alerting mechanisms.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Scaling up control plane capacity to prevent future overload issues. \n* Enhancing monitoring and alerting for the control plane status. \n* Conduct benchmark and scalability testing of the control plane in Pre-Prod environment. \n* Arrange detailed sessions with our technology vendor to optimize Box's Service Mesh infrastructure.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",
