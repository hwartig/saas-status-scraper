          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Uploads, Web Logins, Downloads, Sign, and Public API. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 10:11AM  and 10:32AM PDT on October 6, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may not have been able to log in, upload/download content, or interact with some components of Sign or some API endpoints. The issue occurred as the result of a configuration change affecting internal routing and DNS infrastructure. We were able to resolve the issue by restoring the original configuration. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue was caused by a configuration change intended to shift traffic between our cloud provider and on-premise infrastructure to a redundant path on the network. This configuration change inadvertently impacted our internal routing and DNS infrastructure, which certain Box services rely on for internal name resolution during network maintenance. The inability for services to resolve internal resources lead to a cascading effect of errors across several services.  After reviewing the incident it was discovered that the redundant path was missing the key route for our DNS infrastructure.  As such, part of the network path between the public cloud and on-premise datacenter were temporarily disrupted. \n\n‌\n\nAs part of Box’s migration to public cloud, our traditional datacenter network was connected to our public cloud vendor with multiple high-bandwidth connections.  As Box has completed its service migration to the public cloud, we are working to reduce the number of these connections being used.  In connection with this effort, we migrated traffic off of two links that were serving as a connection between the cloud and our DNS infrastructure.  Due to a missing configuration, the DNS-specific route was not being propagated throughout the network as expected; as a result, when these two links were turned off, our cloud infrastructure temporarily lost access to our DNS infrastructure.  This caused our internal services to stop being able to perform DNS lookups between each other.  At 10:32AM PDT, these links were turned back on, which allowed us to restore the original configuration and remediate this issue. However, because our configuration pipelines were also impacted by this issue and unable to connect to our DNS infrastructure, these links had to be turned back on manually, which impacted our time to remediation.\n\n‌\n\nBox has been migrating to a public cloud platform over the course of 2022-2023 to improve overall performance and reliability. Our DNS infrastructure is one of the final components that will be migrated to be hosted in public cloud. This migration is expected to be completed in the coming quarter and will give our public cloud infrastructure the ability to have this DNS locally instead of relying on these connections.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improve change procedure for routing changes involving interim hybrid connectivity critical infrastructure.  This will provide extra oversight over changes of this type to minimize the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future.\n* Finish the migration of DNS infrastructure into public cloud.\n* Improve resilience of our configuration pipelines so that impact to production does not also impact these pipelines. \n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nOn October 2, 2023, between 09:50 am PDT and 10:27 am PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have had a degraded experience or difficulty accessing Public API, Downloads, Uploads, Login, and Sign. The issue occurred due to a change to one of our backend systems that created a bottleneck that impacted other internal services. We were able to resolve the issue by deploying more instances of the service experiencing the bottleneck. In addition, we are implementing improvements for enhanced control over the flow of traffic within our backend systems. We are also working to establish new alerts on the impacted processes that will decrease time to detect and mitigate similar issues if they occur in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nBox services are underpinned by a common service communication layer called “Service Mesh” providing Box’s services with the abilities to securely communicate and automatically adapt the scale of the services to traffic bursts. During this incident we observed that the Service Mesh layer did not behave as expected. Specifically, the impacted service did not auto-scale as planned and, as a result, the service became overwhelmed leading to the issue. A deeper analysis of the issue demonstrated that the existing Service Mesh configuration, while optimum for the on-premise deployments, was not optimized for the traffic profile experienced in the public cloud.\n\n‌\n\nWe have been working with the technology vendor for our Service Mesh implementation to tune the configuration according to the new environment and have been rolling out the changes incrementally. We have also increased the capacity on critical services while rolling out these changes to minimize reliance on auto-scaling during that period.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Configure limits for the number of retries within internal systems to improve performance during peak traffic times.\n* Implement additional back pressure “circuit breakers” within our backend systems to protect the system from overloading in the event that similar conditions occur in the future.\n* Improve error handling to better differentiate Service Mesh errors from application errors.\n* Improve monitoring measures to automatically detect, diagnose, and remediate such issues before customers are actually impacted.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 12:40 am PDT, on September 28, 2023, and 03:20 am PDT, on September 28, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have had a degraded experience or difficulty accessing Public API, Downloads, Uploads, Login, and Sign. The issue occurred due to an observed latency in one of our internal services responsible for providing security recommendations to the application.  We were able to resolve the issue by deploying more instances of the impacted service. In addition, we are implementing improvements for enhanced control over the flow of traffic within our backend systems. We are also working to establish new alerts on the impacted processes that will decrease time to detect and mitigate if a similar issue take place in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nBox services are underpinned by a common service communication layer called “Service Mesh” providing Box’s services with the abilities to securely communicate and automatically adapt the scale of the services to traffic bursts. During this incident we observed that the Service Mesh layer did not behave as expected. Specifically, the service did not auto-scale as planned and as a result, the service became overwhelmed leading to the issue. A deeper analysis of the issue demonstrated that the “Service Mesh” configuration, while optimum for the on-premise deployments, was no longer adapted to the traffic profile experienced in the public cloud.\n\n‌\n\nWe have been working with the technology vendor for our Service Mesh implementation to tune the configuration according to the new environment and have been rolling out the changes incrementally. We have also increased the capacity on the critical services while rolling out the changes to not rely on auto-scaling during that period.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Configure limits for the number of retries within internal systems to improve performance during peak traffic times.\n* Implement additional back pressure “circuit breakers” within our backend systems to protect the system from overloading in case of similar issues.\n* Improve error handling to better differentiate Service Mesh errors from application errors.\n* Improve monitoring measures to automatically detect, diagnose, and remediate such issues before customers are actually impacted.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time, users may have encountered errors while loading Box Notes documents. The issue occurred as a result of slow leadership election in a coordination service. The issue resolved itself due to automated service recovery mechanisms. In addition, we are tuning this recovery mechanism to execute much more promptly to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\nWe are conducting a full engineering postmortem and our overview is subject to change with further analysis and findings. In the event our continuing investigation yields further substantive findings, we may publish additional analysis after the conclusion of the full engineering postmortem.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nOn September 12, 2023 between 5:50 PM PDT and 9:40 PM PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, customer email notifications including password reset or 2-factor authentication code emails may have been delayed. The issue occurred due to the loss of internet access in one Availability Zone during a scheduled firewall redeployment. We were able to resolve the issue by manually updating routing configuration on the affected instances. In addition, we are working on improving our per-instance health-checks so that they do not take any traffic until they are ready.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nDuring our investigation, the root cause of the incident was identified as a network routing misconfiguration that occurred during the scheduled deployment. This led to loss of internet access in one Availability Zone, thereby causing latencies in customer email notifications including password reset or 2-factor authentication code emails. We have enhanced our post deployment verification by adding a check to ensure that instances are serving traffic effectively. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Integrate network configuration setup in the image creation workflow instead of post-creation to establish consistency.\n* Enhance the existing monitoring setup with improved alerting features to expedite issue identification and resolution.\n* Optimize our per-instance health check to prevent instances from receiving traffic until they are fully prepared.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time, customers may have experienced transient failures in the Events API and delays in synchronizing files via Box Drive. The issue occurred because of a sudden surge in customer traffic that overloaded an isolated part of our infrastructure. The issue was resolved once the infrastructure automatically scaled up to handle the load.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred due to our services experiencing a sudden surge in traffic volume from Box Drive. This surge caused the services managing our user events API to run in a degraded state. All these services had automatic scaling enabled, and as they received increased load the services automatically scaled up to accommodate the surge. Due to some limitations in detecting and automatically scaling up new servers, some customer requests experienced failures or delays during this time. The system stabilized once the scale up was complete.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Tune request parameters like timeouts and retry policies across all the services involved.\n* Re-evaluate our auto-scaling configurations to scale up the servers sooner when they receive increased traffic.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 8:52 PM PT and 9:19 PM PT on September 6th, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users may have been unable to login to Box using SSO. The issue occurred due to resource constraints after migrating SSO service as part of cloud migration efforts. We were able to resolve the issue by to increasing our capacity to handle traffic spikes. In addition, we have improved our metrics for better monitoring of our service to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nWe migrated the SSO login service to cloud on September 6th at 11 AM PT. This migration was performed during a maintenance window scheduled between September 5th and 8th. As part of this migration, we modified the architecture of the service to match our standard engineering practices. However, during the peak traffic in Japan on the same day, the SSO service was limited by resources and failed to detect the issue. As a result, some users were unable to log in to Box.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improve monitoring \n* Improve load testing process\n* Performance tuning to enhance resiliency\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 2:41 PM PT on August 22, 2023 and 7:30 AM PT on August 23, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users may not have been able to view certain images embedded inside Box Notes. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change in our ongoing effort to improve performance and stability. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the faulty change. In addition, In addition, we are working to improve our testing and deployment processes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue was caused by a change in the configuration of the server fleet responsible for processing Box webapp traffic. The change was aimed at consolidating configurations such that further reliability and user experience improvements can be developed and deployed faster in the future. Unfortunately, the change inadvertently impacted embedded image rendering in Box Notes, which caused some customers to experience difficulty viewing images embedded in Box Notes. Additionally, the testing conducted as part of our standard deployment process did not address this specific facet of Box Notes, and as a result, this issue was not detected prior to deployment. Additionally, incident detection and mitigation took longer than normal because there was no alert configured to escalate in case of failed embedded image renders in Box Notes.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Implement automated testing for Box Notes embedded image rendering\n* Add alerts for Box Notes embedded image render failures\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, some Box users may have experienced increased errors or slowness when accessing [Box.com](http://Box.com), Uploads, Downloads, Public API, Logins and Box Sign.  The issue occurred due to a misconfiguration being applied during an upsize process on one of our database pods, which caused the database pod to become unhealthy when load increased during the issue.  We were able to resolve the issue by deploying the correct configuration.  In addition, we will be adding alerts to detect the misconfiguration so it can be fixed before causing impact.  \n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe database pod involved in this issue was manually upsized on August 3rd as a proactive measure in case of high load.  The upsize process used an incorrect command that misconfigured the pod such that it was not able to take advantage of the increased capacity during the issue.  During the period of time immediately after the upsize and before the issue, there was an opportunity to detect the misconfiguration and fix it before causing impact, but there is currently no alert in place for that detection.  \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Alert when a database pod’s runtime configurations are stale  \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take this opportunity to provide an analysis of this issue and the corrective actions we have taken in response.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe issue occurred due to one of our services experiencing a surge in users from Box Drive  This surge caused the service to run in a degraded state. At the root of this incident were capacity constraints that our existing servers could not adequately manage. We were able to resolve the issue by adding additional capacity to the service. Additionally, we have set up alerts designed to notify our on-call engineering team when server utilization approaches the set limits, allowing for immediate corrective action.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Capacity increase to ensure our servers can handle projected user traffic surges\n* Alerts to notify on-call engineering when servers are operating near its limit so corrective actions can be taken immediately\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn Wednesday, August 16th 2023, between 6:52pm and 7:14pm PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users may have experienced delays in Box Drive synchronizing changes. We were able to resolve the issue by allowing our automated recovery to fully complete for the affected service. In addition, we will be refining our auto-scaling tuning to ensure capacity is maintained throughout the duration to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.  \n\n**Analysis**\n\nBox has been internally migrating services to improve both latency and availability. During this time, a service located in a region outside of its dependencies experienced a partial reduction in available capacity during a shift in traffic to a co-located region. This resulted in additional latency during the recovery that may have been noticed by Box Drive users.  \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Migrate affected services to be co-located in a single region to minimize latency\n* Tune auto-scaler to ensure planned capacity is available during any future migrations\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 6:43am PT and 9:02am PT on August 16, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have experienced issues when loading document previews or searching for documents. The issue occurred as a result of database latency and load which had downstream impacts on other services. We were able to resolve the issue by by increasing duration limits for database calls from downstream services. In addition, we are working on ensuring these downstream services are more resilient in the case of database latency in order to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nStarting around 2:30am PT on August 16th, a DB pod started to run hot which caused latency to increase for calling services.  DB latency stayed high through the morning which, when combined with increased traffic, eventually lead to calling services being rate limited starting at 6:43am PT.  The rate limit errors increased until around 8:30am PT when DB latencies came down to normal levels.  Rate limits were draining slowly and it was decided to increase the rate limit for calling services to enable full recovery.  With rate limits increased, full recovery happened at 9:02am PT.  \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improve resiliency of calling services in cases of DB latency.\n* Improve visibility into calling services in cases of increased traffic.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 21:30 and 23:00 PT on Wednesday, August 9th 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time users may have been unable to view or edit File Request settings, to create new File Request links, or to view the File Request view page. The issue occurred as a result of a recent configuration adjustment made to enhance service availability and reliability. We were able to resolve the issue by augmenting resources to the impacted workloads. In addition, we are instituting regular capacity audits and reassessing the setup of analogous services to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nOur investigations pinpointed the issue to our service migration to a new environment. An unintended under-provisioning in server deployment occurred, influenced by the specific environment and the scaling tools in use. This provisioning discrepancy rendered the service vulnerable to traffic spikes. With existing scaling metric challenges, this led to resource depletion and subsequent service disruptions.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Conduct a thorough capacity review for all recently migrated services.\n* Proactively increase resource allocation for similar services.\n* Refine our scaling strategies to better accommodate traffic fluctuations.\n* Augment our alerting and monitoring systems for quicker issue detection and resolution.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

Users saw an error “Failed to load collections” on their left navigation when trying to load Box and also saw an error “Failed to load annotations” when previewing a file with annotations. As part of ongoing efforts to improve our infrastructure at Box, this was part of a planned infrastructure migration. At the time of the migration, these services were unexpectedly operating with less capacity and were unable to serve all traffic. We were able to resolve the issue by increasing the capacity of our infrastructure powering these services.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nAs part of our recent updates to service infrastructure we performed various updates, including ability to automatically scale these services to handle demand in a performant manner. A misconfiguration in connection with these updates inadvertently resulted in a temporary outage of one our services. We have since then provided impacted services appropriate capacity to operate on the new infrastructure and plan to further refine thresholds that will allow us to operate in a more stable and performant manner.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Make sure our service infrastructure has adequate capacity to avoid extended outages.\n* Add additional alerts and monitoring on top of existing monitoring to catch and remediate issues faster.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, users may have degraded experience or difficulty accessing Public API, Downloads, Uploads and Sign. The issue occurred due to an outage of an internal secrets management system that failed after a rare spike in requests from other systems. We were able to resolve the issue by restarting the front ends of the secrets management system to shed connections. In addition, we scaled up the capacity for the secrets management system as well as modified internal clients to reduce the magnitude of future spikes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe internal secrets management system’s file descriptor and connection limits had been increased two months before this issue occurred. The increases were intended to improve system performance during anomalous conditions, but the system’s TCP ephemeral port range remained too small. A request spike consumed the available ephemeral ports on the hosts, resulting in the system becoming unavailable.  \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Tuned the system’s limits to prevent the port exhaustion condition from reoccurring\n* Improvements made to reduce the recurrence of high magnitude request spikes\n* The connection limiting front end is being replaced with an improved load balancer\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the current state and we may update as more information is confirmed._ \n\n \n\nOn July 20, 2023 between 12:52pm PDT and 1:14pm PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties accessing Box’s marketing sites \\([www.box.com](http://www.box.com) and [box.com](http://box.com)\\). During this time, visitors to Box’s marketing sites were temporarily blocked due to a suspected DDoS attack. The issue occurred as a result of Box’s marketing site vendor mitigating a suspected DDoS attack that also impacted legitimate traffic as well. The issue was resolved once the automated mitigation was turned off. We are working on improving our false-positive detection as well as improving the DDoS mitigation overrides to unblock legitimate traffic to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\nWe are conducting a full engineering postmortem and our overview is subject to change with further analysis and findings. In the event our continuing investigation yields further substantive findings, we may publish additional analysis after the conclusion of the full engineering postmortem.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, customers may have experienced delays when using Notifications, Box Relay/Workflow, Search, Conversion and Uploads. We would like to take this opportunity to provide an analysis of this issue and the corrective actions we have taken in response.\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred due to one of our services experiencing high latency when communicating with a backend cloud database. This caused the service to run in a degraded state. We were able to resolve the issue by adding additional capacity to the service. In addition, we are working on improving performance and reliability of the service to better handle increase in latency when communicating with the backend cloud database. \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Make changes to the service to improve performance and reliability to prevent the service from getting degraded due to high latency when communicating with backend cloud database.\n* Add additional logging to help troubleshoot any future issues between this service and backend cloud database.\n* Update our runbook on how to quickly recover if the service experiences similar issues in the future.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween July 19, 2023 12:20PM Pacific time and 12:40PM Pacific time on July 19, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users may have experienced longer latencies than usual for content downloads and previews. The issue occurred due to an error in the validation step conducted by one of Box’s cloud partners during a configuration change. The issue resolved when our cloud partner’s change validation eventually timed out. As a result of this issue, we are updating our change control process to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nDuring this incident Box was updating a configuration with a memory store instance used in some of the internal Box caching layers. Before applying the change, our cloud partner performs a validation test. During this test the validation encountered an error and eventually timed out. During this time, requests to the cache were hanging, causing downloads to stall for an extended time for a response.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Evaluate and adjust cache timeout values\n* Increase cache related performance metrics\n* Updated runbooks to disable caches or flip to inactive cache before making configuration changes\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting previewing of vector-based watermarked documents. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween Monday, July 10th, 2023 at 10:40 AM PDT and Tuesday, July 11th at 3:48 AM PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have experienced intermittent preview errors for documents that had vector-based watermarking enabled. The issue occurred as the result of a recent update that caused a date/time formatting change that was not compatible with our watermarking service. We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back then change and patching the affected service to properly handle the date/time format change. In addition, we are working to improve detection as well as the robustness of handling these types of issues to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nA system package which is responsible for handling internationalization and formatting of strings was updated. The new version of this package included significant whitespace related changes from the The Unicode Common Locale Data Repository \\(CLDR\\) which included change that introduced a Narrow Non-breaking Space \\(Unicode U\\+202F\\) in place of a standard space \\(Unicode U\\+0020\\). This character was not supported in the font that was used by the watermarking service which caused the watermark application to fail in the vector-based watermarking feature.\n\nThis incident revealed some areas for improvement in terms of robustness and testing strategy for this service.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Ensure that we handle all expected unicode characters for date formatting as defined by the The Unicode Common Locale Data Repository \\(CLDR\\)\n* More robust handling of non-supported Unicode characters in general\n* More comprehensive testing to minimize the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Box. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 12:10am PDT and 1:02am PDT on July 03, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some Box users may have experienced increased errors or slowness when accessing Box.com, Public API, Box Sign and SSO services. In connection with a planned migration of certain user traffic to a new system, that system’s connection limits were exceeded under high load, which resulted in the system being unavailable for new connections. We were able to resolve the issue by temporarily routing user traffic back to our old system. In addition, we adjusted the configuration of the new system to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe new system we migrated user traffic to the week prior had a connection limit setting unknown to us. Under high load situations, we saw that limit starting to drop new connections, which resulted in errors and slowness for some users. We routed user traffic back to the old system to relieve stress on the new system and to allow us to reconfigure the new system. We have turned off the connection limits on the new system and have been serving out of that new system since.\n\nAdditionally, this issue revealed a gap in our monitoring when requests were being dropped while passing through this layer in our architecture, which contributed to our time to recovery. Additional monitoring to address this gap is being implemented.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Turning off connection limits where such connection limits are not necessary.\n* Actively monitor and test if connections limit are turned back on again in the future.\n* Add distributed tracing to quickly identify where in our stack the problem lies.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, users may have experienced blank Admin Console \\(AC\\) pages. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change in our ongoing effort to enhance the performance and resiliency of our deployment workflow. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting to the previous version. In addition**,** we are working on improving our deployment processes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n**Analysis**\n\nWe recently migrated a critical functionality of our deployment workflow to a new system. Unfortunately, this change resulted in an unexpected issue with a downstream service due to a misconfiguration. As a consequence, only a partial set of files got copied correctly during the release, leading to missing required files and causing users to see a blank page when accessing the Admin Console.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Include additional validation steps in our post deployment procedure.\n* Simplify the deployment process by eliminating reliance on the downstream service at fault in this incident.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, users may have experienced degraded performance or difficulty accessing Public API, Downloads, and Uploads. The issue occurred as a result of a cut fiber line on a third-party cloud provider’s network. The issue resolved once the cloud network was able to more evenly distribute traffic to address this issue. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nPrior to the impacted timeframe, one of our third-party cloud providers experienced a cut fiber line. As a result, there was temporary packet loss between two data centers resulting communications issues across Public API, Downloads, Uploads and Web Logins. In response, traffic was subsequently rerouted around the impacted line; however, some Box users may have temporarily experienced degraded performance due to backup links approaching saturation as traffic was rerouted. The impact was resolved as soon as the cloud network was able to appropriately distribute traffic to account for this issue.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Redundancy is already in place to prevent a complete outage. \n* Cloud provider is investigating adding capacity to prevent any future degradation during an event. \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 2:04 PM PDT and 10:32 PM PDT on June 7, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users may have received partial or no results in response to file searches. The issue occurred due to an underlying infrastructure issue where a Search cluster was missing a portion of its index. We were able to resolve the issue by immediately routing traffic to one of our backup clusters. In addition, we are working to add restrictions and additional checks to better prevent traffic from being routed to an incomplete index in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOn June 7th, we performed commands while troubleshooting a separate issue that inadvertently caused a Search cluster to serve customer traffic while missing a portion of its index. This resulted in some customer search queries returning with partial or no results. To remediate this issue, we routed traffic to one of our backup clusters.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Applying checks and restrictions to prevent actions that could result in an empty search index\n* Using automation to perform further checks and restrictions\n* Improving our alerting to catch situations where traffic is routed to an incomplete index\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time, people using the Box webapp may have experienced increased latency or slowness. The issue occurred because of an erroneous change which constricted the amount of effective hardware capacity for the service dedicated to processing our webapp traffic. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the this change. In addition, we are improving our processes and observability techniques to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis**\n\nOn Friday, May 12, 2023, we deployed a change aimed at improving the processing efficiency of our webapp traffic. Although this change did not result in any observed issues over the weekend, as our traffic increased as APAC and EMEA customers came back to work on Monday morning, it became evident that the change was constricting the effective capacity of the service responsible for processing our webapp traffic. Once this issue was detected, we were able to diagnose the issue and the problematic change was reverted. This ultimately remediated the problem.\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Adjusting our deployment processes to improve monitoring of changes during customer traffic peaks to better detect, diagnose and remediate such issues before customers are actually impacted.\n* The efficiency change that caused the problem has been re-thought and is now implemented in the way that is much less likely to cause any customer impact.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.\n\n‌\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting the Metadata Query API. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 9am and 2pm PT on May 5th, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some requests to the Metadata Query API returned stale or outdated results. The issue occurred due to a delay in the replication of instance create and update events to the query datastore. We were able to resolve the issue by filtering out some events that were causing retries, dead lettering and hence delaying replication. In addition, we have identified the underlying pattern of events that was causing delays in the replication pipeline and patched our replication processing code to handle them gracefully, to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nWhen Metadata instances are mutated using the Box API or one of our applications, events containing the details of these mutations are emitted to a replication stream that is then processed by a pipeline without delay. This ensures the latest state is consistently available to be queried against using the Metadata Query API. We employ multiple optimizations to maintain the near-realtime characteristics of this query functionality, while ensuring all data is replicated consistently.\n\n‌\n\nDuring this incident, one of the optimizations we leverage encountered an unexpected pattern of data, causing it return errors and trigger retries. These retries slowed down processing of the replication stream, causing lag to grow and resulting in queries returning outdated information for some customers. After identifying and filtering out these events causing errors, we were able to get the replication pipeline to once again successfully process events without adding delay. We also increased the rate at which these replication events are processed, in order to recover from the lag that had built up and fully catch up.\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Identified and patched for event pattern that caused errors and hence retries, ensuring graceful handling of unexpected data patterns.\n* Increased batch size for replication stream processing to prevent lag from building up and to enable faster recovery from any backlogs in the future.\n* Improved observability and increased sensitivity of alerts, to ensure faster detection of errors and/or lag build up.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 11:15 pm PT on April 25, 2023 and 8:40 am PT on April 26, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, one of our cloud partners experienced an infrastructure malfunction that impacted one of their European regions. This impact caused the region to exhibit elevated error rates and increased request latency which caused upload and download requests in Box to backup. We were able to resolve this issue by updating storage policies in this European region to use a different but still compliant region. In addition we have taken on a number of near term and longer term remediations to to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.   \n  \n**Analysis**   \nStarting at approximately 7:00 pm PT on April 25, 2023 one of our European partners experienced an infrastructure problem in one availability zone of their France region. At 11:15 pm PT this malfunction triggered a fire that motivated an evacuation of datacenter personnel and resulted in region wide degradation. At this time requests that utilized storage in the impacted region saw increased latency and elevated error rates. This resulted in elevated request rates due to retries and longer request times. We remediated the issue by updating the storage policies to reroute the requests to another region that was still compliant with residency requirements, and by updating the behavior of internal retry and rate limiting logic.  \n  \n**Corrective Actions**  \nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Update internal rate limiting logic to trigger automatic scale-out sooner\n* Update monitoring for all storage locations\n* Audit request timeouts\n* Extend automated health checking and automated policy re-routing to cover additional degradation cases\n\n  \nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting the Box Web App and public API. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn April 19, 2023 between 21:02 and 22:02 \\(Pacific Time\\),  some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, these users experienced slowness and intermittent failures interacting with certain parts of the Box Web App and public API, including Logins, Uploads and Downloads. The issue occurred as a result of an internal process overloading the database pod responsible for serving approximately 1% of our customers. We were able to resolve the issue by stopping the internal process that was stressing the database. In addition, we have already started the process of upsizing and splitting the database as part of our routine maintenance for busy database pods to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis**\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, the database pod on which this issue took place was identified as a candidate for splitting due to organic growth of the database. The split successfully completed in May 2022. In December 2022, the database pod was once again identified as a candidate for splitting due to additional organic growth since the previous split.  The second split kicked off in December and was estimated to complete in 8 weeks. However, a latent bug caused duplicate processing of some of the data on the pod; as a result, the split took longer than originally planned.  Load on the database pod continued to increase while the split was taking place and occasionally reached levels that were not sustainable, resulting in impact such as what was seen on April 19. While waiting for the split to be completed, the database pod was migrated onto more powerful hardware, providing some relief. The database split ultimately completed at the end of April 2022.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improve our database split process to reduce duplicative processing, improve efficiency in performing splits, and better scoping completion timeline. \n\n* Identify even earlier database pods that require a database split\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time, some users experienced slowness and intermittent failures interacting with certain parts of the Box webapp and public API, including while applying Box Shield Classifications and sending documents for signature via Box Sign. The issue occurred as a result of a gradual new feature rollout that overwhelmed a cache held inside one of the key middleware services. We were able to resolve the issue by deploying a code change that prevented the feature rollout framework from overwhelming the cache and restarting the impacted service to clear the cache. In addition, we are working on improving monitoring and alerting around the impacted cache to be able to detect and address similar problems before they impact our users in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOur investigation shows that the incident was caused by an inefficient configuration of the experimentation framework that was used to begin gradual rollout of a new feature. This framework unexpectedly stored decision results in the cache, regarding whether the feature should be shown to the user. This decision storage overran the cache, causing other entries to be evicted. This meant that the web application ended up having to reconstitute the frequently used and expensive to compute information that would have ordinarily been in this cache. The effective capacity of our web application processing was thus dramatically reduced, which caused exhaustion and subsequent degradation of several of our latency sensitive services. The incident remediation was slowed down significantly by the lack of explicit alerting on the web application server’s cache.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Fix the experimentation framework such that it doesn’t overwhelm the web application server’s cache\n* Add explicit monitoring and alerting around the usage of the web application server’s cache\n* Implement a fast way to clear the web application server caches on the entire server fleet\n* Add explicit monitoring and alerting around expensive operations performed by the web application server that should ordinarily be performed rarely due to being cached effectively\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Box Sign. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 11:00 AM PT and 1:21 PM PT on April 7, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, Box Sign users were unable to start the signing process using the upload new file feature. Users were presented with an error banner when uploading new documents. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change made to standardize error code messages, which inadvertently impacted an internal interaction. We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back the relevant change. In addition, we have identified several corrective actions, detailed below, to minimize the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nAs part of an effort to standardize error codes returned in API responses, we rolled out a change that updated some existing codes. This change impacted an internal interaction, in the Box Sign document upload flow, that was explicitly relying on a prior error code value. When the relevant error situation arose, the code was unable to detect and mitigate the recoverable error, resulting in it being propagated out to the end-user in the form of an error banner.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Added additional tests to prevent modifications of existing error codes until it is deemed safe to do so.\n* Started the process to deprecate custom error code values, only keeping the standardized HTTP response codes.\n* Augmenting continuous end-to-end testing on pre-production environments for increased observability around critical user journeys.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, customers may have experienced delays when using Box Relay. We would like to take this opportunity to provide an analysis of this issue and the corrective actions we have taken in response.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred due to one of our services in a specific region experiencing high latency when communicating with a backend cloud database. This caused the service in that region to run in a degraded state. We were able to resolve the issue by routing all of the upstream traffic to another region where the service was healthy. In addition, we are working with the cloud service provider to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\nThe existing logs and metrics we had during the incident did not reveal any indication as to what might have caused the degradation. So, following the recommendation from our cloud provider, we temporarily enabled extensive cloud logging for that region, diverted some traffic and monitored the service for degradation. The service was not degraded during this time. While the extensive logging has since been disabled, we have continued to closely monitor the service in that region and have not observed any anomalies or further signs of degradation.  We will continue to monitor for any anomalies.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Our existing metrics promptly alert the on-call engineer when such issues occur.  We have additionally made the following changes to our runbook that the on-call follows:\n\n    * Enable the extensive cloud logging and seek immediate assistance from the cloud provider on the issue.\n    * Once adequate data is gathered, divert traffic away from the degraded region.\n    \n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Box Drive users. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 2:55am and 9:20am PDT on March 29th, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users may have experienced delays in Box Drive synchronizing changes. The issue occurred due to a regularly scheduled automatic internal credential rotation failing to propagate completely. We were able to resolve the issue by manually synchronizing the affected service with the latest credentials. In addition, we are ensuring services self-validate against the credential freshness constraints to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis**\n\nKey rotation is one aspect of the broader key management and a component Box’s overall security system, which requires key holders to update their keys regularly before they are revoked. In the event an automatic key rotation occurs and a key holder does not refresh their credentials within their valid lifetime they will no longer be able to authenticate and receive authorization to communicate with external systems. In the case of this issue, a single internal service responsible for managing realtime events did not update its credentials following an automatic rotation and thus not able to make those new events available to our customers.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Add an alert to page on-call engineers should the affected service fail to update its credentials to enable a user to investigate and manually complete the task\n* Update the affected service to add an additional automatic check for credential freshness to watch for rotations and update automatically\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",
