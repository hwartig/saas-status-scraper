During this time, some recently uploaded and updated documents were delayed in processing and did not appear in Search results. The issue occurred during a code change to improve Search’s processing capability. We were able to resolve the issue by removing the change and increasing the computing power of our pipeline. In addition, we have increased alerting and implemented stricter testing and more automation to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\nWe are conducting a full engineering postmortem and our overview is subject to change with further analysis and findings. In the event our continuing investigation yields further substantive findings, we may publish additional analysis after the conclusion of the full engineering postmortem.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, some users were unable to search for items that were uploaded or changed during the impacted timeframe. The issue occurred as a result of an automation intended to optimize our messaging infrastructure. The automation put in place did not drive the optimization at a controlled rate, which caused overutilization of available resources and resulted in end-user impact. We resolved this issue by stopping the optimization automation. In addition, we have added guardrails to limit the optimization process to a subset of infrastructure to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future._ \n\n_Analysis_ \n\n_On the day of the incident, we observed increased disk activity in our messaging infrastructure. This was the result of an automated optimization process to balance out disk space evenly across the underlying hosts in our messaging infrastructure. The optimization process ran across all the hosts, resulting in increased disk activity that affected our search service. As a result of this issue, our search service temporarily failed to index any file changes made after the onset of the issue. As a result, we stopped the optimization automation, and as a result, we observed incremental recovery until all the messages were processed.

This caused a high internal queue build up as the system backlog built due to CPU resource contention.  As the queue size build up was significant, the recovery took some time. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* We are working towards reviewing and adding more alerting for improved diagnostics for such issues. \n* We have added a caching layer to reduce the dependency between our backend datasets and customer applications. This should reduce the potential impact to the customer experience if we face a similar issue.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 10:24am PST and 11:20am PST on February 6th, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, a subset of Box’s external load balancers became unstable due to extremely high CPU usage, which resulted in intermittent issues for customers trying to access the Box Service. The issue occurred as a result of network socket exhaustion on external load balancers which was caused by a migration of certain traffic to the public cloud. We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back the migration at issue as well as increasing available load balancer capacity. In addition, we are working on updating the required amount of resources and capacity we need in the public cloud for these migrations as well as improving our monitoring to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\n‌\n\nAs Box moves to the public cloud, we have migrated multiple workloads from our on-prem datacenters to the public cloud. The service in question is responsible for an extremely high connection count. While moving this service away from the last on-prem datacenter it occupied, the load balancers in the public cloud became temporarily overwhelmed. This resulted in the exhaustion of available network sockets for the load balancers to use. This drove up CPU usage as a result of connection retries, eventually causing instances to fail healthchecks and be recreated. As instances were being recreated, they would drop traffic and move the high connection count to a different instance, further compounding the issue. We were able to resolve this issue by rolling back the migration, which relieved the connection counts on the load balancers. Furthermore, by adding more capacity we were able to provide the necessary headroom to recover completely. We are working on adding capacity to our cloud load balancing stack and updating our monitoring to immediately point to the root cause if a similar issue is encountered in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Add additional capacity to the public cloud load balancing stack\n* Update existing monitoring to account for network socket usage and exhaustion\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

In addition, we are working on improving our change management process to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future._ \n\n‌\n\n_Analysis _\n\n_The issue was a result of a change from HTTP metrics communication in the region to HTTPS metrics communication. This change failed and resulted in a communication failure between our metrics agent and the metric sink it writes to. During the communication failure, the metrics agent will locally cache the data up to a max capacity. In our deployments, we did not have enough resources deployed for this cache. The impact was resource exhaustion in a cluster running our upload and download services resulting in frequent service restarts due to an out-of-memory exception_\n\n‌\n\n_Corrective Actions_\n\n_The following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:_\n\n* _Increased the deployment resources to allow for the additional capacity_ \n* _Added specific alerting for this scenario_ \n\n‌\n\n_We are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n‌\n\nBetween 10:00 AM PST on January 31, 2023, and 4:00 PM PST on February 1, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some enterprise admins may have experienced delays running Box admin reports. The issue occurred due to backend resource exhaustion in our reporting system. We were able to resolve the issue by removing idle reporting resources and adjusting our internal configurations governing recycling of idle reporting resources. In addition, to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, we will be provisioning additional monitoring to detect an excess buildup of idle reporting resources before they impact the customer experience. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe Enterprise Reporting product dynamically creates compute clusters to run reports requested by customers and then destroys them once they are idle in order to free up capacity for new clusters to be launched. The root cause of this issue was that the process responsible for destroying these reporting compute clusters was unable to keep up with the rate at which clusters were scheduled for destruction, creating a backlog that eventually resulted in temporary exhaustion of the compute resource available to run customer reports. As a result, some enterprise admins may have experienced delays in running reports during the impacted timeframe. Additionally, this issue took longer to detect than it otherwise may have because our monitoring initially failed to distinguish the resulting customer report backlog from the expected higher customer reporting traffic that typically occurs at the end of each month.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Update the reporting cluster destruction process so that it can keep pace with the rate at which clusters are provisioned\n* Add direct monitoring for a backlog of reporting clusters that are scheduled for destruction\n* Add direct monitoring for exhaustion of available reporting compute resources\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, a newly re-deployed load balancer instance had a faulty network connection that caused it to be unreachable from our internal network. This resulted in timeouts for any traffic processed by this load balancer, and as a result, users may have experienced upload or download operations time out.

The issue started when a scheduled re-deploy task created a load balancer instance with an incorrect internal network configuration. Additionally, our existing health checks did not account for validating the instance’s internal connectivity. As a result, all traffic that was sent to this particular instance timed out, in addition to any telemetry that would have been generated by the instance. The issue was corrected by removing the instance from the group, and we are working on improving our health checking as well as observability to reduce the risk of similar issues occurring again in the future. \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Importing missing external load balancer metrics to observability platforms for alerting and dashboards\n* Adding additional pre-enable health-checks to new load balancer instances\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nOn January 23rd from 11:48am PT to 1:07pm PT and on January 24th from 7:49am PT to 8:36am PT and 5:07pm PT to 9:02pm PT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users experienced higher than normal latency and/or timeouts when trying to access content in Box via one of our applications or our Public API. Specifically, some users of the Metadata Query API experienced elevated latencies and timeouts.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred due to  an overload of a localized area of one of our datastores, resulting in the request queue backing up and causing latency degradation for Downloads, Box Notes, Metadata and other related services for some users. This additional load was induced by an internal data migration our engineering team was performing at that time. One of the changes needed to perform this migration caused an unexpected amplification of requests to a localized area of one of our datastores containing schema information. This change was tested prior to deployment, performed as expected after deployment, but caused impact at peak load.\n\n‌\n\nRequests to this server developed a backlog which affected latency of Box Metadata generally, resulting in elevated latencies and some timeouts for dependent Box services. We were able to resolve the issue by reducing load on this datastore via additional caching, shedding some load and rolling back some recent changes. We are working on process and tooling improvements to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Patched a bug in our data migration code that caused read requests amplification and validated it.\n* Closed a gap in observability, in order to identify similar load increases before they reach a tipping point and cause impact.\n* Increased capacity for this localized area that holds schema information, in order to handle any future surges in traffic more gracefully.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, users may have experienced slow login times as well as failures when attempting to upload and download files. \n\n## **Analysis**\n\nThe issue occurred as an unexpected result of a resource utilization priority conflict during the deployment process of an internal tool. Specifically, an internal service being deployed to our production environment had a higher resource utilization priority than another critical system process, which subsequently failed when affected nodes’ resources were exhausted. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the change.\n\nIn addition, we are improving our change risk assessment criteria and health alerts for this kind of tool, and working to design a more progressive deployment process for this internal tool to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n## **Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improving our risk assessment criteria for deploying these types of tools. \n\n* Extending our capacity guidelines to provide more clarity around system resource consumption and better resource distribution.\n* Increasing our alerting to detect early warning signs of systems running at a higher capacity than expected.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 5:16 PM PDT and 7:40 PM PDT on November 23, 2022, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, it was not possible to access Shield Admin pages, the Shield Admin dashboard and the Classification Label admin pages. Additionally, some users may have experienced issues manually classifying files and folders. The issue occurred as a result of an inadequate capacity configuration that prevented a service from starting gracefully after rebooting. We were able to resolve the issue by increasing the capacity of the affected service. In addition, we are working to extend our capacity guidelines and to improve our alerting capabilities to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe service affected by this incident recently experienced a significant increase in traffic as a result of the release of a new feature. Although the service remained stable after the feature’s release, the temporary degradation of another supporting service resulted in an increased number of retries, which in turn resulted in increased processing activity. As a result of this increased CPU usage, the impacted service eventually rebooted, but was unable to effectively reboot because the memory currently allocated for that service was inadequate during this window of increased processing activity. We were able to resolve the issue by increasing the capacity of the affected service.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Extending our capacity guidelines to provide more clarity around system restart considerations.\n* Increasing our alerting to detect early warning signs of systems running at a higher capacity than expected.\n* Improving the documentation of our existing alerts to allow us to respond more quickly to system reboot issues.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, permissions checks were not available for certain workflows, which caused multiple services to stop allowing access. The issue occurred due to a non-backward-compatible change that was introduced while adding a feature intended to improve the performance of permissions checks. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the change. In addition, we are working to improve our testing and monitoring processes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis**\n\nPermissions checks depend on a schema. In order to make checks faster, we are adding support for bulk lookups, a feature that will reduce the number of requests to other internal services and thus improve the response time.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween November 15, 2022 at 7:12 am PST and November 16, 2022 at 3:04 am PST, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, customers may have experienced preview conversion latencies for Sharepoint or Microsoft Excel files. The issue occurred as a result of a reduction of available conversion capacity as part of ongoing data center migrations. We were able to resolve the issue by provisioning additional capacity in their place. In addition, operational process and tooling will be implemented to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nAs part of a data center migration, hosts for the conversion service were removed from production before replacement capacity was brought online, resulting in a 15% loss to conversion capacity. The capacity loss and root cause were identified right away and additional capacity was brought online to compensate. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Process updates have been enabled to better facilitate communication between Infrastructure and Capacity teams to minimize the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future.\n* Changes to automation for the validation of capacity requests have been enacted.\n* Canary rollout of windows related changes for the conversion service will be enabled. \n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time, some Box users may have experienced issues with uploads, downloads, notes and public API. The issue occurred as a result of a latent issue with platform workload initialization controllers failing to detect new workloads. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue was the result of a controller component that provides service-to-service authentication failing to detect that new workloads needed to be processed. This controller monitors an internal API for new workloads that match certain criteria indicating that the workloads are initializing and waiting for internal credentials. In this case, the impacted controller failed to detect new workloads waiting in the API results that should have been processed. We were able to resolve the issue by restarting the controllers and the new workloads were processed. In addition, we also added alerts to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. The existing alerting in place was monitoring the controllers for errors, but because the controllers were idle, no alerts were immediately raised. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improve alerting on the workloads if they time out while waiting for the controller to process them.\n* Replace the controller with a more robust method of authenticating workloads.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n‌\n\nBetween between 07:42 AM and 08:47 AM PDT on September 14, 2022 , some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, customers may have experienced issues with SSO Logins and Box Notes. The issue occurred due to a failure in the network connecting one of our points of presence \\(POPs\\) to Box’s Application Data Center \\(ADC\\).  We were able to resolve the issue by implementing backbone routing changes to bypass the affected network path**.** In addition, we are working towards migrating to the public cloud to leverage their diverse and global network to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue was the result of a network failure affecting one of our POPs. These POPs possess two redundant transport circuits that are on diverse physical paths and are provided by two separate providers providing redundant connectivity. During this incident, the impacted POP experienced simultaneous failures of both of its redundant circuits due to separate service provider incidents. \n\n‌\n\nSimultaneous failure of both transport circuits is a rare occurrence; in this case, the root cause was identified by the service providers as a “fiber cut“.  This dual failure isolated the impacted POP from the rest of the network. In response, we implemented a temporary backbone routing change to resolve the issue at that time, which temporarily diverted the impacted traffic to a sub-optimal path. Later the connectivity was restored to the original preferred path when one of the circuit recovered. After that, the second circuit also recovered, thereby restoring the redundant connectivity to the POP. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* We have migrated 100% of our edge traffic to GCP. By doing this we have further reduced the dependence on on-premise POPs. \n* This now enables us to leverage Google’s global POP presence, further improving our global reach close to the customer location.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain this issue and the steps we have taken to keep it from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 09:48 AM PDT and 10:15 AM PDT on July 8, 2022, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users experienced high latency and errors on JWT Login, Upload, Download, API and Box Notes features. The issue occurred because of an error in applying a configuration change to our traffic rate limiting infrastructure. We were able to quickly identify and resolve resolve the issue by rolling back the affecting change. Below is a summary of our analysis and corrective actions to prevent similar impact going forward. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe configuration change that caused the impact is related to our API infrastructure.  Part of the infrastructure is a component that controls the allowable request rate for various API endpoints based on a number of factors.  These factors are controlled by a configuration file.  Our engineering team was updating this configuration file to add a new rate limit entry when they applied an entry missing a required parameter.  As a result, the rate limiter system could not load its configuration, which caused the system to fail.\n\nAs a result of this incident we have identified a few key areas for improvement. First, we are improving our procedures regarding changes to the rate limiting system, adding more detail specifying required parameters and sample configurations for use in validating requests.  We have also conducted additional training with the team to reinforce the procedure. Additionally, we are investing in better automated validation of requests when they are submitted, ensuring they are well formed \\(i.e., they contain all required parameters\\).  This investment will reduce the likelihood of an incorrect configuration being applied to the system.  We believe the combination of automated configuration validation and improved documentation and training significantly improves our rate limiting system and mitigates similar future mistakes.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improving our procedures regarding changes to the rate limiting system by adding more detail and sample configurations for use in validating requests.\n* Conducting additional training to reinforce the procedure for making changes to the rate limiting system.\n* Improving automated validation of requests to minimize the likelihood of incorrect configurations in the future.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nOn July 7th, 2022 between 6:02 PM PDT and 7:10 PM PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have experienced higher than normal latency, timeouts and/or errors when trying to access Box via one of our applications or our public API. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue occurred due to instability in one of our HBase clusters. To improve the capacity of the Box Metadata service, our engineering teams deployed an expanded data storage cluster on the afternoon of July 7th. This cluster was tested prior to its deployment, and performed as expected in production immediately after deployment. Approximately 3 hours after the deployment of this cluster, a single server within the cluster exhibited dramatically increased latency caused by a defective memory module. This resulted in users experiencing degradation of uploads, downloads, Box Notes, and other related services. Our automated server failure detection methods did not detect this server as failed, and as a result, traffic continued to be directed to this server. Requests to this server developed a backlog, which affected latency of Box Metadata generally, which resulted in timeout errors and slow performance in other Box services. We were able to resolve the issue by diverting traffic to a healthy passive cluster. In addition, we are working on process and tooling improvements to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* The defective server was removed from service and repairs effected.\n* Revised datastore cluster deployment, onboarding and validation processes to prevent this issue from recurring in the future and to improve detection of problematic deployments.\n* Improving resilience of Box services to high latencies when accessing datastores to minimize the impact of any similar issues in the future. \n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn June 22, 2022 between 01:37pm PDT and 01:46pm PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have had trouble accessing Box Notes.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nIn connection with a planned update to Box Notes, certain traffic was inadvertently deployed to an incorrect data center. This caused users to temporarily encounter errors when trying to access Box Notes. We were able to resolve the issue by redeploying traffic to the correct data center. In addition, we are making changes to our documentation and building automated safeguards to prevent this issue from happening again in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Updating internal processes and documentation to check for potential issues prior to deployment.\n* Incorporating additional automations to safeguard against incorrect deployments.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Box. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn June 7, 2022 between 7:03 PM and 8:33 PM PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, Downloads, Uploads, Notes, and Public API were impacted. \n\n **Analysis**\n\nThe issue occurred when one of our internal services experienced abnormally high traffic and accumulated more requests than it could handle. Due to the abnormally high traffic, the impacted service was temporarily unable to keep up with demand, which caused the service to fail. As a result, some users were not able to download files or experienced delays while working in Box.  We were able to resolve the issue by allocating more hardware capacity to the service. In addition, we are working on improving our capacity planning and testing processes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nTo prevent issues of this type from happening again, the following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Increasing hardware allocation to the affected services to reduce the likelihood that these services will experience similar issues. \n* Making improvements to our capacity planning and testing processes to reduce the likelihood of this issue recurring in the future.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n Sincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, uploads, downloads, logins, and public API experienced some failures or errors.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe issue occurred when the leader node of an internal clustered system failed a soft restart. During a maintenance window, an internal infrastructure system that uses a leader-standby clustering model failed to elect a new leader. As a result, some users experienced issues with uploads, downloads, logins, and public API. Additionally, during the impacted timeframe, internal client services of the system did not rely on cached data as a fall-back, which exacerbated the issue.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 3:18am PDT and 5:08am PDT on April 8th, 2022, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some requests to the Enterprise Events API returned errors. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred due to a misconfiguration in the underlying database.  Patching of the distributed data store for Enterprise Events temporarily brought the cluster into a bad state; as a result, the service responsible for Enterprise Events queries experienced request timeouts. We were able to resolve the issue by restarting the impacted service, which returned it to its baseline performance. In addition, we are working on improving our automated alerting and recovery mechanisms to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Standardizing connection handling and health checks on the affected service to prevent recurrence and automate recovery.\n\n* Updating the incident response process to improve recovery time for the affected service.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, the Box Sign user interface may not have been accessible for some users and signed documents may have been processed with a delay. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nOn February 1st networking and firewall changes were made in our ongoing effort to improve performance and stability. Due to this change our services were unable to reach out to an external service required for digitally signing documents. \n\nOur deployment/QA process did not test each individual external endpoint, and so this issue was not identified in the deployment/QA process. In addition, some alarms were misconfigured that would have reduced service degradation.  We were able to resolve the issue by whitelisting this external endpoint. \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improvements to our deployment/QA processes to test each individual endpoint for infrastructure changes. \n\n* Reconfiguration of alarms and improvements to observability with more granular alarms.\n\n* Improvements to our replay process that can restart failed tasks to mitigate consequences should other issues resulting in failed task occur in the future.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, a subset of users utilizing Box for EMM may have encountered an error while attempting to log on. The issue occurred as a result of a configuration change that resulted in customers using EMM being unable to authenticate to Box. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the change. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe impacted back-end service accesses encrypted content from Box’s database by use of an encryption key. This key was previously supplied from our configuration system. Recently, Box migrated certain keys and other sensitive information to a different system. This migration resulted in a misconfiguration, which caused the service to be unable to properly read the key. As a result, a subset of customers may have experienced errors while attempting to log on.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improving Mobile EMM testing processes\n* Enabling infrastructure to test EMM use cases in internal environments\n* Improving alerting and monitoring capabilities of critical mobile services\n* Making improvements to the back-end service to handle custom key-names and improve error messaging to help diagnose issues faster\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, customers were not able to access Box Sign. The issue occurred due to a new firewall change, and we were able to resolve the issue by rolling back the new change. \n\n  \n**Analysis** \n\nThe problematic change had previously been pushed to our development environment without any issues. When pushing the change into our staging and production environments, there was a misconfiguration in the firewall change that blocked some traffic. The change was pushed to staging first, but a misconfiguration in our oncall alerts prevented the alert from properly reaching the oncalls. After 6 hours, this change was implemented in production with the same misconfiguration, which resulted in some service communications being blocked. A mix of the misconfiguration of oncall notification alerts and lack of proactive notifications of changes and change data caused diagnosis of this issue to take extra time.\n\n  \n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Changing configurations to correct the oncall notification alert configuration.\n\n* Changing practices to improve proactive notification of changes and change data. \n\n  \nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.
