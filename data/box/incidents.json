          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting most parts of the Box webapp and public API; including Logins, Uploads and Downloads. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn January 9, 2024, between 11:10 AM PT and 12:15 PM PT, users experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users experienced slowness and failures interacting with most parts of the Box webapp and public API, including Logins, Uploads and Downloads. The issue was triggered by a change that impacted Kubernetes clusters in one of the regions where we run our critical services. At 11:18 AM PT this change was rolled back. After rolling back the change, systems began to recover around 11:27 AM. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOn January 9th, 2024, we made a configuration change to deploy a new daemonset to the dedicated Kubernetes clusters running our core data services, which caused resource exhaustion and eviction of our core data services on those nodes. The daemonset deployment pipeline erroneously allowed the change to be promoted to an entire region instead of the planned gradual rollout, which resulted in service interruption impacting most of our customers. To address this issue, we rolled back the daemonset deployment. After the daemonset was rolled back, the evicted core data services began to be restored and our systems began to recover; however, in two of our three clusters, this process was delayed by a scheduler limitation, elongating the duration of impact. We adjusted the resource requests for our core data services to speed up recovery of these two clusters, restoring normal operations at 12:15pm.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* We have paused the daemonset pipeline until we can ensure it employs safe incremental rollout processes.\n* We are updating the daemonset pipeline to validate resource allocations before deployment and ensure a gradual production rollout to reduce the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future.\n* We have adjusted the priority of our application services, including the core data services, to be higher than daemonsets to ensure their capacity is protected.\n* We are adjusting our Kubernetes configurations to enable faster restoration of service through guaranteed capacity and buffers.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.\n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "## Background\n\nOn December 15, 2023 Box experienced a severe service degradation. During this time, users experienced slowness and failures interacting with all parts of the Box webapp and public API; including Logins, Uploads and Downloads. Additionally, some customers might have seen small subsets of their content created during the incident become sporadically hidden. \n\n‌\n\nThe issue was triggered by a partial power loss that impacted persistent disks in one of the cloud infrastructure availability zones in which we operate, leading to multiple active databases being impacted. Although our database infrastructure is architected with zonal redundancy, the unique nature of the failure surfaced a gap in our zonal health monitoring and presented unforeseen challenges for our automatic recovery tooling, extending the resolution time. We were ultimately able to resolve the issue by manually shifting traffic out of the impacted availability zone. \n\n## Analysis\n\nBox’s database infrastructure is designed to be able to withstand problems impacting a single availability zone. Our database replicas are spread across multiple availability zones for redundancy and we have automated tooling in place that can detect faults and shift traffic to other replicas should that become necessary. Both the redundant replicas and automated tooling are exercised regularly as part of our normal operations.\n\n‌\n\nIn this case, when the partial power loss took place, it impacted several of our databases in a way that compromised their ability to serve high traffic volumes. Diagnosing this type of partial zonal failure was challenging due to the high variability of impact across multiple databases. Because of this unique confluence of factors, the root cause proved challenging to diagnose and mitigate both for our automation and incident responders, extending time to resolution. Once we confirmed the impact was limited to a single availability zone, we were able to effectively mitigate all active databases out of the impacted zone by leveraging other availability zones.\n\n‌\n\nDuring the course of our mitigation efforts, replication topologies may have caused certain newly created files or file versions to intermittently not appear in a limited number of Box accounts. These intermittent visibility issues were resolved as replication topologies were normalized and caches were later cleared. \n\n## Next Steps and Corrective Actions\n\nWe are continuing to conduct a comprehensive engineering postmortem.  Therefore, this report is subject to change based on our further analysis and findings.\n\n‌\n\nThe following corrective actions have been, or continue to be, implemented:\n\n* improve our ability to diagnose partial availability zone degradations like the one we encountered in this incident;\n* improve our automatic incident mitigation system to better handle partial zone degradations;\n* improve our testing strategies for the database tier mitigation systems to cover this type of failure scenario; and\n* conduct a comprehensive audit of our production systems to validate their resilience to zonal failures and degradations.\n\n‌\n\nThe above noted corrective actions will strengthen our efforts to safeguard against partial zone degradations, reduce mitigation timeframes and support enhanced testing and prevention efforts.  \n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "## Background\n\nWe recently addressed issues affecting Box Webapp, Public and Uploads & Downloads. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future. \n\nBetween 4:30 AM PST and 5:05 AM PST on December 15, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During these times, some users may have experienced slowness and failures interacting  with parts of the Box Webapp and public API, including Uploads and Downloads. The issue occurred due to an issue with the deployment of a new DB Access Control service on our database fleet.  We were able to resolve the issue by temporarily disabling the problematic service. In addition, we are working to improve our testing and rollout process for services being deployed to our database fleet to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe DB Access Control service is a service that enables new user access controls to be applied automatically and frequently.  This allows for faster development of new DB functionality that requires access control changes, resulting in faster team velocity and ultimately more stable and reliable infrastructure.  \n\nOn the morning of December 13th, an operator started the rollout of the DB Access Control service by deploying it to a single database pod. At that time, it was configured to execute its work every 10 minutes.  Approximately 10 minutes after the deployment, we saw degradation on that pod, causing the impact seen on December 13. The operator suspected that the service frequency was the cause and remediated by configuring the service to execute its work once a day at a low-traffic time. The next steps should have been to validate the changes in a way that would not result in customer impact and then deploy it again on a single pod. However, the standard process was unintentionally not adhered to in this case and the change was instead deployed across the fleet, leading to additional impact as seen on December 15.\n\nIn addition to optimizing the DB Access Control service to be less resource-intensive, we intend to make some process changes in response to this issue. There is already a general standard process that should be followed when deploying services to the Database fleet. However, to minimize the likelihood of similar situations occurring again, we are updating our documentation to better ensure that all operators have a comprehensive understanding of the standard process and that such process is consistently followed. \n\n## Next Steps and Corrective Actions\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* The relevant DB service was temporarily disabled to remediate the issue.\n* The relevant DB service has been optimized to be less resource-intensive and will automatically refuse to run during high-traffic times\n* Rollout process for all DB services will be more thoroughly documented\n* Operators will receive additional training to ensure that they have a comprehensive understanding of the documented rollout process\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Box Webapp, Public and Uploads & Downloads. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future. \n\n‌\n\nBetween 10:28 AM PST and 10:38 AM PST on December 13, 2023 and between 4:30 AM PST and 5:05 AM PST on December 15, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During these times, some users may have experienced slowness and failures interacting  with parts of the Box Webapp and public API, including Uploads and Downloads. The issue occurred due to an issue with the deployment of a new DB Access Control service on our database fleet.  We were able to resolve the issue by temporarily disabling the problematic service. In addition, we are working to improve our testing and rollout process for services being deployed to our database fleet to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe DB Access Control service is a service that enables new user access controls to be applied automatically and frequently.  This allows for faster development of new DB functionality that requires access control changes, resulting in faster team velocity and ultimately more stable and reliable infrastructure.  \n\n‌\n\nOn the morning of December 13th, an operator started the rollout of the DB Access Control service by deploying it to a single database pod. At that time, it was configured to execute its work every 10 minutes.  Approximately 10 minutes after the deployment, we saw degradation on that pod, causing the impact seen on December 13. The operator suspected that the service frequency was the cause and remediated by configuring the service to execute its work once a day at a low-traffic time. The next steps should have been to validate the changes in a way that would not result in customer impact and then deploy it again on a single pod. However, the standard process was unintentionally not adhered to in this case and the change was instead deployed across the fleet, leading to additional impact as seen on December 15.\n\n‌\n\nIn addition to optimizing the DB Access Control service to be less resource-intensive, we intend to make some process changes in response to this issue. There is already a general standard process that should be followed when deploying services to the Database fleet. However, to minimize the likelihood of similar situations occurring again, we are updating our documentation to better ensure that all operators have a comprehensive understanding of the standard process and that such process is consistently followed. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* The relevant DB service was temporarily disabled to remediate the issue.\n* The relevant DB service has been optimized to be less resource-intensive and will automatically refuse to run during high-traffic times\n* Rollout process for all DB services will be more thoroughly documented\n* Operators will receive additional training to ensure that they have a comprehensive understanding of the documented rollout process\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed an issue affecting multi-factor authentication logins. We would like to further explain the issue and action items we had taken to prevent it from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 9:00 AM PST and 12:30 PM PST on November 6, 2023, some users experienced latency and difficulty logging into Box. During this time, users logging in to Box with multi-factor authentication may have encountered slow responses or failures during the login process. Upon investigation, we determined that the cause of this issue was the result of a single enterprise repeatedly retrying programmatic session termination calls for all its users, which temporarily overburdened the multi-factor authentication service. The issue was resolved when the user was temporarily prevented from using the session termination API.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe issue occurred due a confluence of factors relating to our session termination API and multi-factor authentication service. Specifically, at the time of this issue, our session termination API did not have a rate limiter in place, which allowed a customer to repeatedly call the API with an excessive number of requests to the multi-factor authentication service. The multi-factor-authentication service additionally did not rate-limit the specific call made to it by the session termination API. Finally, the internal retry logic for timed-out requests continued to load the multi-factor authentication service. As a result, due to the unusually high session termination calls, our multi-factor authentication service became overburdened and resulted in the temporary impact to users.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Adding rate limits to the session termination API and the multi-factor authentication service.\n* Enhancing dashboard and alerts related to session termination API and multi-factor authentication.\n* Optimization of the logic between the session termination API and multi-factor authentication service to improve throughput.\n* Investigation of retry logic to prevent perpetuating overload situations.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting the Box for Salesforce Integration. We would like to take this opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 12:17 PM PDT and 7:36 PM PDT on Friday, November 3, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while using our Box for Salesforce integration. During this time, customers using the integration experienced issues loading the Box Folder widgets, toolkit automation, and authentication flows. This occurred as a result of a back-end change that resulted in the integration's authentication credentials being invalidated. We were able to resolve the issue by resetting the credentials. In addition, we are updating our change control processes and software to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\n‌\n\nThe Box Developer Console is part of our main web application, and is an interface that developers use to manage their application’s properties. The console also includes functionality to reset application credentials when necessary, which is typically reserved for credential rotations or similar scenarios. In this issue, the functionality to reset the application credentials was inadvertently triggered during other, more routine updates. As a result of these invalidated credentials, some users may have temporarily experienced difficulties using the integration. The issue was detected by Box employees within minutes of the change, and we were able to resolve the issue by restoring the application’s credentials.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Restoring the Box for Salesforce integration’s credentials\n* Update tooling and processes so that routine, low risk updates to applications are separated from rare, but necessary high risk capabilities, like resetting application credentials.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here, and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 2:32 pm and 4:05 pm PST on November 3, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, file-related notifications were temporarily delayed. The issue occurred due to an expired authentication token used in one of our environments. We were able to resolve the issue by rotating the token, at which point entire backlog of unsent notifications was sent. In addition, we are working on putting additional safeguards in place to alert us beforehand in such cases earlier to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue was caused by an expired token used to distribute software within Box infrastructure. As a result, there was temporary inability for the affected mechanism to distribute the current version of software. This has led to a number of jobs triggering continuously to pause, since these could not obtain the current version of software due to this issue. One of these jobs that was impacted was batching job for notifications, and this caused the temporary impact to end users. Due to a limitation in alerting mechanism in this area, the alert did not fire as expected as a warning beforehand. \n\n‌\n\nWe were able to resolve this issue by rotating the token, which restored the impacted functionality. Once the problem was mitigated, the notification job started firing again and quickly sent out the historical backlog of unsent notifications. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improve the token renewal alerting automation to detect and fire alerts for any expiring tokens\n* Improve the token distribution and renewal process to ensure our core infrastructure services always have valid authentication tokens\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 9/29/2023 9PM PDT and 10/12/2023 4:10PM PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users were unable to find some documents that were uploaded, modified or moved during the specified period. The issue occurred as a result of changes to our infrastructure to more uniformly distribute the index across all shards in our search clusters. Specifically, a new sharding scheme was applied to our live serving search clusters resulting in some recently updated documents going to the the wrong shards. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting back to the old sharding scheme for live clusters. In addition, we are working on adding mechanisms to safely alter sharding scheme for live production clusters to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue occurred due to alteration of the sharding scheme used for indexing to live serving search clusters. This change inadvertently resulted in inconsistency between the sharding scheme used to update documents and the sharding scheme used to query the cluster. As a result, a small portion of documents that were created, updated or moved on Box during the issue time window were indexed to a different shard than what the user queries were being processed on. Since the sharding scheme only impacted a small portion of content on Box \\(less than 1%\\), most documents were still searchable, and this issue only impacted a relatively small number of files.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Adding checks in the system to ensure indexing and query pipeline are using the same sharding scheme for a specific cluster\n* Adding tooling to identify if document is being indexed to the wrong shard on a cluster\n* Update procedure for changing sharding scheme to prevent unintentionally applying it to all serving clusters.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Uploads, Web Logins, Downloads, Sign, and Public API. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 10:11AM  and 10:32AM PDT on October 6, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may not have been able to log in, upload/download content, or interact with some components of Sign or some API endpoints. The issue occurred as the result of a configuration change affecting internal routing and DNS infrastructure. We were able to resolve the issue by restoring the original configuration. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue was caused by a configuration change intended to shift traffic between our cloud provider and on-premise infrastructure to a redundant path on the network. This configuration change inadvertently impacted our internal routing and DNS infrastructure, which certain Box services rely on for internal name resolution during network maintenance. The inability for services to resolve internal resources lead to a cascading effect of errors across several services.  After reviewing the incident it was discovered that the redundant path was missing the key route for our DNS infrastructure.  As such, part of the network path between the public cloud and on-premise datacenter were temporarily disrupted. \n\n‌\n\nAs part of Box’s migration to public cloud, our traditional datacenter network was connected to our public cloud vendor with multiple high-bandwidth connections.  As Box has completed its service migration to the public cloud, we are working to reduce the number of these connections being used.  In connection with this effort, we migrated traffic off of two links that were serving as a connection between the cloud and our DNS infrastructure.  Due to a missing configuration, the DNS-specific route was not being propagated throughout the network as expected; as a result, when these two links were turned off, our cloud infrastructure temporarily lost access to our DNS infrastructure.  This caused our internal services to stop being able to perform DNS lookups between each other.  At 10:32AM PDT, these links were turned back on, which allowed us to restore the original configuration and remediate this issue. However, because our configuration pipelines were also impacted by this issue and unable to connect to our DNS infrastructure, these links had to be turned back on manually, which impacted our time to remediation.\n\n‌\n\nBox has been migrating to a public cloud platform over the course of 2022-2023 to improve overall performance and reliability. Our DNS infrastructure is one of the final components that will be migrated to be hosted in public cloud. This migration is expected to be completed in the coming quarter and will give our public cloud infrastructure the ability to have this DNS locally instead of relying on these connections.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improve change procedure for routing changes involving interim hybrid connectivity critical infrastructure.  This will provide extra oversight over changes of this type to minimize the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future.\n* Finish the migration of DNS infrastructure into public cloud.\n* Improve resilience of our configuration pipelines so that impact to production does not also impact these pipelines. \n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nOn October 2, 2023, between 09:50 am PDT and 10:27 am PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have had a degraded experience or difficulty accessing Public API, Downloads, Uploads, Login, and Sign. The issue occurred due to a change to one of our backend systems that created a bottleneck that impacted other internal services. We were able to resolve the issue by deploying more instances of the service experiencing the bottleneck. In addition, we are implementing improvements for enhanced control over the flow of traffic within our backend systems. We are also working to establish new alerts on the impacted processes that will decrease time to detect and mitigate similar issues if they occur in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nBox services are underpinned by a common service communication layer called “Service Mesh” providing Box’s services with the abilities to securely communicate and automatically adapt the scale of the services to traffic bursts. During this incident we observed that the Service Mesh layer did not behave as expected. Specifically, the impacted service did not auto-scale as planned and, as a result, the service became overwhelmed leading to the issue. A deeper analysis of the issue demonstrated that the existing Service Mesh configuration, while optimum for the on-premise deployments, was not optimized for the traffic profile experienced in the public cloud.\n\n‌\n\nWe have been working with the technology vendor for our Service Mesh implementation to tune the configuration according to the new environment and have been rolling out the changes incrementally. We have also increased the capacity on critical services while rolling out these changes to minimize reliance on auto-scaling during that period.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Configure limits for the number of retries within internal systems to improve performance during peak traffic times.\n* Implement additional back pressure “circuit breakers” within our backend systems to protect the system from overloading in the event that similar conditions occur in the future.\n* Improve error handling to better differentiate Service Mesh errors from application errors.\n* Improve monitoring measures to automatically detect, diagnose, and remediate such issues before customers are actually impacted.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 12:40 am PDT, on September 28, 2023, and 03:20 am PDT, on September 28, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have had a degraded experience or difficulty accessing Public API, Downloads, Uploads, Login, and Sign. The issue occurred due to an observed latency in one of our internal services responsible for providing security recommendations to the application.  We were able to resolve the issue by deploying more instances of the impacted service. In addition, we are implementing improvements for enhanced control over the flow of traffic within our backend systems. We are also working to establish new alerts on the impacted processes that will decrease time to detect and mitigate if a similar issue take place in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nBox services are underpinned by a common service communication layer called “Service Mesh” providing Box’s services with the abilities to securely communicate and automatically adapt the scale of the services to traffic bursts. During this incident we observed that the Service Mesh layer did not behave as expected. Specifically, the service did not auto-scale as planned and as a result, the service became overwhelmed leading to the issue. A deeper analysis of the issue demonstrated that the “Service Mesh” configuration, while optimum for the on-premise deployments, was no longer adapted to the traffic profile experienced in the public cloud.\n\n‌\n\nWe have been working with the technology vendor for our Service Mesh implementation to tune the configuration according to the new environment and have been rolling out the changes incrementally. We have also increased the capacity on the critical services while rolling out the changes to not rely on auto-scaling during that period.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Configure limits for the number of retries within internal systems to improve performance during peak traffic times.\n* Implement additional back pressure “circuit breakers” within our backend systems to protect the system from overloading in case of similar issues.\n* Improve error handling to better differentiate Service Mesh errors from application errors.\n* Improve monitoring measures to automatically detect, diagnose, and remediate such issues before customers are actually impacted.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 10:07am PDT and 10:33am PDT on September 22nd, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, the Box marketing site \\([www.box.com](http://www.box.com)\\) was inaccessible and users attempting to access the site encountered a 404 error page. The issue occurred as a result of instability in Box’s marketing site vendor’s network. We were able to resolve the issue by working with the vendor to deploy a temporary workaround to remediate this issue**.** In addition, we are working with the vendor to improve their rollout verification process and also to identify Box-owned processes to remediate similar issues should they arise in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe cause of this issue was a change in the leader election process of a key component in the vendor’s configuration management pipeline. This change triggered a race condition in a downstream component in the pipeline, which resulted in overwriting some customer configurations with an empty configuration. While the change was rolled out gradually with a canary process, the vendor’s automated rollout verification mechanism was not able to identify the issue. The issue was eventually detected by the vendor’s data plane monitoring systems, which alerted due to the rise in errors being served.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned by the vendor and Box:\n\n* Vendor: Identify and resolve the underlying race condition in configuration lifecycle that resulted in the unintended modifications.\n* Vendor: Improve tooling and processes to more quickly and safely rollback components in the configuration management system.\n* Vendor: Improve internal monitoring and visualization to better assess and understand source of error response alerting to expedite detection and remediation.\n* Box: Identify and implement Box-owned solution to remediate similar issues should they arise in the future.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Box Notes. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nOn Monday, Sept 18, 2023, between 07:26 AM PST and 07:33 AM PST, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have encountered errors while loading Box Notes documents. The issue occurred due to a slow leadership election in a coordination service. The issue resolved itself, due to health automation processes recreating the unhealthy service. In addition, we plan to adjust our health check automation to resolve similar issues more quickly should they occur again in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nBox Notes leverages multiple Apache Zookeeper ensembles to coordinate distributed compute services. Each ensemble is composed of a leader and several followers. When a leader fails, the remaining members quickly elect a new leader, who ensures that the other followers’ data is up to date, and continue running without issue, a process that usually takes less than a second and causes no impact.\n\nIn this incident, the leader failed, but the election of a new leader took an unusually long period of time, due to an unexpectedly large amount of data that needed to be synchronized. Due to the amount of time this election took, our health checks triggered an automated process that rebuilds unhealthy ensemble members, which disrupted the election process and further impacted the time taken for the election. Upon investigation, we determined that our health checks should have waited longer before deciding that corrective action was required.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Tune our health checks to be less aggressive in deciding when a resource needs to be recreated.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time, scheduled workflows created in Relay were not executing and non-scheduled workflows were executing with delays. The issue occurred as a result of code change introduced earlier this year related to migration of scheduled workflows to new servers. We were able to resolve the issue by fixing the faulty code, which resolved the issue with our internal message queueing system that was responsible for this impact. In addition, we improved logging and observability to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe investigation has shown that the root cause was faulty code, which in specific circumstances, was creating multiple duplicate workflows, rapidly filling internal message queues. This resulted in delays in the execution of non-scheduled workflows and additionally temporarily prevented scheduled workflows from executing correctly. The faulty code was introduced as a performance improvement while doing the migration of scheduled workflows to new servers earlier this year. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Corrected the faulty code responsible for this issue.\n* Introduce more testing of this code to reduce the likelihood of similar issues occurring again in the future.\n* Add alerts and metrics measuring number of scheduled workflow executions and introducing additional logging to facilitate investigation of similar cases in future\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nOn September 12, 2023 between 5:50 PM PDT and 9:40 PM PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, customer email notifications including password reset or 2-factor authentication code emails may have been delayed. The issue occurred due to the loss of internet access in one Availability Zone during a scheduled firewall redeployment. We were able to resolve the issue by manually updating routing configuration on the affected instances. In addition, we are working on improving our per-instance health-checks so that they do not take any traffic until they are ready.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nDuring our investigation, the root cause of the incident was identified as a network routing misconfiguration that occurred during the scheduled deployment. This led to loss of internet access in one Availability Zone, thereby causing latencies in customer email notifications including password reset or 2-factor authentication code emails. We have enhanced our post deployment verification by adding a check to ensure that instances are serving traffic effectively. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Integrate network configuration setup in the image creation workflow instead of post-creation to establish consistency.\n* Enhance the existing monitoring setup with improved alerting features to expedite issue identification and resolution.\n* Optimize our per-instance health check to prevent instances from receiving traffic until they are fully prepared.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 2:00 AM PDT and 2:21 AM PDT on September 12, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, customers may have experienced transient failures in the Events API and delays in synchronizing files via Box Drive. The issue occurred because of a sudden surge in customer traffic that overloaded an isolated part of our infrastructure. The issue was resolved once the infrastructure automatically scaled up to handle the load.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred due to our services experiencing a sudden surge in traffic volume from Box Drive. This surge caused the services managing our user events API to run in a degraded state. All these services had automatic scaling enabled, and as they received increased load the services automatically scaled up to accommodate the surge. Due to some limitations in detecting and automatically scaling up new servers, some customer requests experienced failures or delays during this time. The system stabilized once the scale up was complete.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Tune request parameters like timeouts and retry policies across all the services involved.\n* Re-evaluate our auto-scaling configurations to scale up the servers sooner when they receive increased traffic.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

As a result, requests from Box Sign were rejected because it was utilizing the same shared service.  We resolved this issue by scaling out the necessary dependent service.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have already been completed or are planned:\n\n‌\n\n* Increase server capacity for all relevant services to handle traffic surges during peak times.\n* Improve monitoring system to detect potential issues before they impact user experience or cause any degradation in quality of service.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, some users may not have been able to view certain images embedded inside Box Notes. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change in our ongoing effort to improve performance and stability. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the faulty change. In addition, In addition, we are working to improve our testing and deployment processes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue was caused by a change in the configuration of the server fleet responsible for processing Box webapp traffic. The change was aimed at consolidating configurations such that further reliability and user experience improvements can be developed and deployed faster in the future. Unfortunately, the change inadvertently impacted embedded image rendering in Box Notes, which caused some customers to experience difficulty viewing images embedded in Box Notes. Additionally, the testing conducted as part of our standard deployment process did not address this specific facet of Box Notes, and as a result, this issue was not detected prior to deployment. Additionally, incident detection and mitigation took longer than normal because there was no alert configured to escalate in case of failed embedded image renders in Box Notes.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Implement automated testing for Box Notes embedded image rendering\n* Add alerts for Box Notes embedded image render failures\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 5:24 pm PDT and 5:30 pm PDT on August 22, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some Box users may have experienced increased errors or slowness when accessing [Box.com](http://Box.com), Uploads, Downloads, Public API, Logins and Box Sign.  The issue occurred due to a misconfiguration being applied during an upsize process on one of our database pods, which caused the database pod to become unhealthy when load increased during the issue.  We were able to resolve the issue by deploying the correct configuration.  In addition, we will be adding alerts to detect the misconfiguration so it can be fixed before causing impact.  \n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe database pod involved in this issue was manually upsized on August 3rd as a proactive measure in case of high load.  The upsize process used an incorrect command that misconfigured the pod such that it was not able to take advantage of the increased capacity during the issue.  During the period of time immediately after the upsize and before the issue, there was an opportunity to detect the misconfiguration and fix it before causing impact, but there is currently no alert in place for that detection.  \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Alert when a database pod’s runtime configurations are stale  \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 6:43am PT and 9:02am PT on August 16, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have experienced issues when loading document previews or searching for documents. The issue occurred as a result of database latency and load which had downstream impacts on other services. We were able to resolve the issue by by increasing duration limits for database calls from downstream services. In addition, we are working on ensuring these downstream services are more resilient in the case of database latency in order to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nStarting around 2:30am PT on August 16th, a DB pod started to run hot which caused latency to increase for calling services.  DB latency stayed high through the morning which, when combined with increased traffic, eventually lead to calling services being rate limited starting at 6:43am PT.  The rate limit errors increased until around 8:30am PT when DB latencies came down to normal levels.  Rate limits were draining slowly and it was decided to increase the rate limit for calling services to enable full recovery.  With rate limits increased, full recovery happened at 9:02am PT.  \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improve resiliency of calling services in cases of DB latency.\n* Improve visibility into calling services in cases of increased traffic.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, some Admin accounts were redirected to their landing page when logging in to the Admin Console. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change in our ongoing effort to use more inclusive language. We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back the change. In addition, we are working to improve our alerting processes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nAs a part of the ongoing effort to use more inclusive language throughout Box, we are replacing instances of “/master” with “/admin” in the Admin Console URL. However, after making the change, some admins experienced problems with redirection to their landing page. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Increase monitoring to help troubleshoot any future issues.\n* Update our testing documentation to prevent this issue from happening again.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time users may have been unable to view or edit File Request settings, to create new File Request links, or to view the File Request view page. The issue occurred as a result of a recent configuration adjustment made to enhance service availability and reliability. We were able to resolve the issue by augmenting resources to the impacted workloads. In addition, we are instituting regular capacity audits and reassessing the setup of analogous services to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nOur investigations pinpointed the issue to our service migration to a new environment. An unintended under-provisioning in server deployment occurred, influenced by the specific environment and the scaling tools in use. This provisioning discrepancy rendered the service vulnerable to traffic spikes. With existing scaling metric challenges, this led to resource depletion and subsequent service disruptions.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Conduct a thorough capacity review for all recently migrated services.\n* Proactively increase resource allocation for similar services.\n* Refine our scaling strategies to better accommodate traffic fluctuations.\n* Augment our alerting and monitoring systems for quicker issue detection and resolution.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 6:00 PM PDT and 6:42 PM PDT on August, 8th 2023, some users may have experienced issues accessing Box Sign and Public APIs. The issue occurred due to insufficient allocation of resources to a new logging mechanism. We were able to resolve the issue by adjusting the configuration of available resources for this new mechanism. In addition, we added alerts to further monitor the resource usage for this new mechanism across all our services to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nDuring this incident, the authorization service within Box started using a new process for exporting logs to remote systems. When the service instances using the new process experienced peak load, traffic exceeded the resource limits allocated for this process. This in turn impacted the authorization service, causing some users to experience difficulty accessing Box Sign and Public APIs.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Increase available resources for the logging mechanism\n* Monitor resource usage for logging mechanism across all services\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

Users saw an error “Failed to load collections” on their left navigation when trying to load Box and also saw an error “Failed to load annotations” when previewing a file with annotations. As part of ongoing efforts to improve our infrastructure at Box, this was part of a planned infrastructure migration. At the time of the migration, these services were unexpectedly operating with less capacity and were unable to serve all traffic. We were able to resolve the issue by increasing the capacity of our infrastructure powering these services.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nAs part of our recent updates to service infrastructure we performed various updates, including ability to automatically scale these services to handle demand in a performant manner. A misconfiguration in connection with these updates inadvertently resulted in a temporary outage of one our services. We have since then provided impacted services appropriate capacity to operate on the new infrastructure and plan to further refine thresholds that will allow us to operate in a more stable and performant manner.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Make sure our service infrastructure has adequate capacity to avoid extended outages.\n* Add additional alerts and monitoring on top of existing monitoring to catch and remediate issues faster.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Public API, Downloads, Uploads and Sign. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn July 26, 2023 between 5:30 and 6:20 PM PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have degraded experience or difficulty accessing Public API, Downloads, Uploads and Sign. The issue occurred due to an outage of an internal secrets management system that failed after a rare spike in requests from other systems. We were able to resolve the issue by restarting the front ends of the secrets management system to shed connections. In addition, we scaled up the capacity for the secrets management system as well as modified internal clients to reduce the magnitude of future spikes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe internal secrets management system’s file descriptor and connection limits had been increased two months before this issue occurred. The increases were intended to improve system performance during anomalous conditions, but the system’s TCP ephemeral port range remained too small. A request spike consumed the available ephemeral ports on the hosts, resulting in the system becoming unavailable.  \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Tuned the system’s limits to prevent the port exhaustion condition from reoccurring\n* Improvements made to reduce the recurrence of high magnitude request spikes\n* The connection limiting front end is being replaced with an improved load balancer\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 12:54pm PDT and 1:14pm PDT on July 20th, 2023, some visitors to Box’s marketing sites were temporarily prevented from accessing those sites. The issue occurred as a result of Box’s marketing site vendor mitigating a DDoS attack that inadvertently also impacted legitimate user traffic. The issue was resolved once the the vendor was able to push an engineering fix to identify legitimate user traffic. In addition, we are working on improving our false-positive detection as well as improving the DDoS mitigation overrides to unblock legitimate traffic to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\n‌\n\nThe cause of the issue was the DDoS attack aimed at Box’s marketing site, which kicked off an automated mitigation by Box’s marketing site vendor. This mitigation consisted of two responses:\n\n1. Blocking traffic that was malformed \\(attack traffic\\)\n2. Blocking traffic volume from a source once it crossed an internal threshold\n\n‌\n\nBecause Box proxies the marketing site traffic through our external load balancers, there is little variance in the source as seen by the vendor, which contributed to the internal threshold signals set by the vendor. This second response was responsible for blocking legitimate user traffic, and was fixed by the vendor’s engineering team. The fix rollout also coincided with a drop in the attack traffic. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Enable additional logging from the vendor to be able to identify mitigation responses as false positives\n* Add mitigation overrides to address false positives when needed\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween July 19, 2023 12:20PM Pacific time and 12:40PM Pacific time on July 19, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users may have experienced longer latencies than usual for content downloads and previews. The issue occurred due to an error in the validation step conducted by one of Box’s cloud partners during a configuration change. The issue resolved when our cloud partner’s change validation eventually timed out. As a result of this issue, we are updating our change control process to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nDuring this incident Box was updating a configuration with a memory store instance used in some of the internal Box caching layers. Before applying the change, our cloud partner performs a validation test. During this test the validation encountered an error and eventually timed out. During this time, requests to the cache were hanging, causing downloads to stall for an extended time for a response.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Evaluate and adjust cache timeout values\n* Increase cache related performance metrics\n* Updated runbooks to disable caches or flip to inactive cache before making configuration changes\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 7/14/23 2:41PM Pacific time and 7/15/23 1:00 PM Pacific time, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have received an error when creating a new Box Note from a saved template. The issue occurred as a result of a recent infrastructure change that is part of an ongoing effort to improve performance and stability. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the change. In addition, we are working to improve our infrastructure rollout processes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. In addition, we have added additional testing and audited service interactions to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nAs part of Box’s continual process of improvement we are migrating much of our legacy infrastructure to a modern platform. As part of this migration we had updated part of our infrastructure that handles content movement to prepare it for an update to our service discovery framework. This change revealed a divergence in behavior between our current and legacy infrastructure. This divergence prevented the creation of a new Box Note from an existing template in some scenarios.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Full audit of Notes interaction with our content stack services\n* Coordinated testing between Notes and content stack teams to ensure successful behavior in current and legacy environments\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween Monday, July 10th, 2023 at 10:40 AM PDT and Tuesday, July 11th at 3:48 AM PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have experienced intermittent preview errors for documents that had vector-based watermarking enabled. The issue occurred as the result of a recent update that caused a date/time formatting change that was not compatible with our watermarking service. We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back then change and patching the affected service to properly handle the date/time format change. In addition, we are working to improve detection as well as the robustness of handling these types of issues to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nA system package which is responsible for handling internationalization and formatting of strings was updated. The new version of this package included significant whitespace related changes from the The Unicode Common Locale Data Repository \\(CLDR\\) which included change that introduced a Narrow Non-breaking Space \\(Unicode U\\+202F\\) in place of a standard space \\(Unicode U\\+0020\\). This character was not supported in the font that was used by the watermarking service which caused the watermark application to fail in the vector-based watermarking feature.\n\nThis incident revealed some areas for improvement in terms of robustness and testing strategy for this service.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Ensure that we handle all expected unicode characters for date formatting as defined by the The Unicode Common Locale Data Repository \\(CLDR\\)\n* More robust handling of non-supported Unicode characters in general\n* More comprehensive testing to minimize the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Box. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 12:10am PDT and 1:02am PDT on July 03, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some Box users may have experienced increased errors or slowness when accessing Box.com, Public API, Box Sign and SSO services. In connection with a planned migration of certain user traffic to a new system, that system’s connection limits were exceeded under high load, which resulted in the system being unavailable for new connections. We were able to resolve the issue by temporarily routing user traffic back to our old system. In addition, we adjusted the configuration of the new system to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe new system we migrated user traffic to the week prior had a connection limit setting unknown to us. Under high load situations, we saw that limit starting to drop new connections, which resulted in errors and slowness for some users. We routed user traffic back to the old system to relieve stress on the new system and to allow us to reconfigure the new system. We have turned off the connection limits on the new system and have been serving out of that new system since.\n\nAdditionally, this issue revealed a gap in our monitoring when requests were being dropped while passing through this layer in our architecture, which contributed to our time to recovery. Additional monitoring to address this gap is being implemented.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Turning off connection limits where such connection limits are not necessary.\n* Actively monitor and test if connections limit are turned back on again in the future.\n* Add distributed tracing to quickly identify where in our stack the problem lies.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n‌\n\nOn June 22, 2023 between 17:05 and 18:02 \\(Pacific Time\\), some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users experienced failures interacting with certain parts of the Box web login, public API and Downloads. The issue occurred as a result of a misconfiguration in a change intended to add new database clusters to accommodate incoming customers. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the change. In addition, we have already implemented process improvements to minimize the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis**\n\nAs part of a routine process, our database team periodically adds new database clusters and makes them available for use via a configuration change. During this incident, as part of the addition of a new database cluster an incorrect command resulted in a misconfiguration that caused some users to experience failures interacting with certain parts of the Box web login, public API and Downloads.  \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Enhance validation process to detect and block this type of misconfiguration before deployment process\n\n* Document and validate change reversal steps ahead of production deployment\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, users may have experienced blank Admin Console \\(AC\\) pages. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change in our ongoing effort to enhance the performance and resiliency of our deployment workflow. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting to the previous version. In addition**,** we are working on improving our deployment processes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n**Analysis**\n\nWe recently migrated a critical functionality of our deployment workflow to a new system. Unfortunately, this change resulted in an unexpected issue with a downstream service due to a misconfiguration. As a consequence, only a partial set of files got copied correctly during the release, leading to missing required files and causing users to see a blank page when accessing the Admin Console.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Include additional validation steps in our post deployment procedure.\n* Simplify the deployment process by eliminating reliance on the downstream service at fault in this incident.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, users may have experienced degraded performance or difficulty accessing Public API, Downloads, and Uploads. The issue occurred as a result of a cut fiber line on a third-party cloud provider’s network. The issue resolved once the cloud network was able to more evenly distribute traffic to address this issue. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nPrior to the impacted timeframe, one of our third-party cloud providers experienced a cut fiber line. As a result, there was temporary packet loss between two data centers resulting communications issues across Public API, Downloads, Uploads and Web Logins.

The impact was resolved as soon as the cloud network was able to appropriately distribute traffic to account for this issue.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Redundancy is already in place to prevent a complete outage. \n* Cloud provider is investigating adding capacity to prevent any future degradation during an event. \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting certain parts of the Box Web App and public API, including Logins, Uploads and Downloads. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 11:35 AM PT and 12:42 PM PT on June 1, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users experienced slowness and intermittent failures interacting with certain parts of the Box webapp and public API, including Logins, Uploads and Downloads. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change in our ongoing effort to improve performance and stability. We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back the code change.  We are working to improve our deployment and monitoring processes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nJust prior to the start of the issue, we deployed a change that introduced a new database query in an attempt to simplify complex legacy queries and reduce database load. This new query was more expensive than anticipated, and caused the database to overload on larger tables in the production environment.  Customers may have experienced failed logins, uploads, and downloads as a result.  This change was tested in our pre-production environments for a week prior to release.  However, our pre-production environments have different load characteristics, making it difficult to identify the problem the query would cause under production load.  We are putting additional processes in place to thoroughly validate any database query changes prior to production deployment in order to prevent this from happening again.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Rework the solution to improve expensive database queries.\n* Improve the deployment process to include more incremental stages, streamline the verification process, and expedite rollback speed.\n* Formalize a process that tests DB effectiveness to better assess query impact when we adjust/create them\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time, people using the Box webapp may have experienced increased latency or slowness. The issue occurred because of an erroneous change which constricted the amount of effective hardware capacity for the service dedicated to processing our webapp traffic. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the this change. In addition, we are improving our processes and observability techniques to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis**\n\nOn Friday, May 12, 2023, we deployed a change aimed at improving the processing efficiency of our webapp traffic. Although this change did not result in any observed issues over the weekend, as our traffic increased as APAC and EMEA customers came back to work on Monday morning, it became evident that the change was constricting the effective capacity of the service responsible for processing our webapp traffic. Once this issue was detected, we were able to diagnose the issue and the problematic change was reverted. This ultimately remediated the problem.\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Adjusting our deployment processes to improve monitoring of changes during customer traffic peaks to better detect, diagnose and remediate such issues before customers are actually impacted.\n* The efficiency change that caused the problem has been re-thought and is now implemented in the way that is much less likely to cause any customer impact.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.\n\n‌\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 9am and 2pm PT on May 5th, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some requests to the Metadata Query API returned stale or outdated results. The issue occurred due to a delay in the replication of instance create and update events to the query datastore. We were able to resolve the issue by filtering out some events that were causing retries, dead lettering and hence delaying replication. In addition, we have identified the underlying pattern of events that was causing delays in the replication pipeline and patched our replication processing code to handle them gracefully, to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nWhen Metadata instances are mutated using the Box API or one of our applications, events containing the details of these mutations are emitted to a replication stream that is then processed by a pipeline without delay. This ensures the latest state is consistently available to be queried against using the Metadata Query API. We employ multiple optimizations to maintain the near-realtime characteristics of this query functionality, while ensuring all data is replicated consistently.\n\n‌\n\nDuring this incident, one of the optimizations we leverage encountered an unexpected pattern of data, causing it return errors and trigger retries. These retries slowed down processing of the replication stream, causing lag to grow and resulting in queries returning outdated information for some customers. After identifying and filtering out these events causing errors, we were able to get the replication pipeline to once again successfully process events without adding delay. We also increased the rate at which these replication events are processed, in order to recover from the lag that had built up and fully catch up.\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Identified and patched for event pattern that caused errors and hence retries, ensuring graceful handling of unexpected data patterns.\n* Increased batch size for replication stream processing to prevent lag from building up and to enable faster recovery from any backlogs in the future.\n* Improved observability and increased sensitivity of alerts, to ensure faster detection of errors and/or lag build up.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",
