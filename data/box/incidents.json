During this time, a datastore used by Shuttle experienced elevated latency, which had a temporary adverse affect on a subset of active Shuttle accounts.  We were able to resolve the issue by reducing the load on this datastore.  \n\nWe are conducting a full engineering postmortem and our overview is subject to change with further analysis and findings. In the event our continuing investigation yields further substantive findings, we may publish additional analysis after the conclusion of the full engineering postmortem.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 9:04am and 10:32am PDT on March 21, 2025, some Box Zones users in Germany and France may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some servers became unresponsive, causing connections to time out for some users in these Box Zones regions. The issue occurred due to a configuration change made as part of a software upgrade, which resulted in some servers losing memory. We were able to resolve the issue by temporarily redirecting some processing activity until the configuration change was fixed. Throughout the duration of the incident, all content continued to be stored in the correct Zones region. We are also implementing additional monitoring and alerting to catch this type of issue sooner to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred due to a configuration change which was made as part of upgrading some software to use the latest Long Term Supported \\(LTS\\) version of Java. The change inadvertently resulted in some servers running out of Java heap memory. We were able to resolve the issue by temporarily processing some European customer traffic using servers in the US until the European servers were back to normal. At no time during the issue was content moved or stored in a different region than the appropriate Box Zones region.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Additional monitoring and alerting is being put into place to catch this type of issue sooner to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n* We are making improvements to reduce the amount of time taken to switch to alternative servers for processing in these and similar issues. \n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting several features across Box, including Logins, Uploads/Downloads, and Notes. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween between 3:06 AM and 4:35 AM PDT on March 19, 2025, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have experienced slowness or occasional errors when interacting with several major features in the Box platform. The issue occurred due to a latent issue that inadvertently caused several caching instances to restart in an unhealthy state while serving traffic. We were able to resolve the issue by temporarily routing traffic away from impacted caching instances until they were manually restored by on-call engineers. In addition, we addressed the underlying code issue that triggered the server restarts and will provide additional controls to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nAt 3:05 AM PDT, the service responsible for management of our caching clusters became unreachable due a latent code bug in its leader election process. Health checks on individual caching VMs misinterpreted the connectivity issue to this central service as a problem with the caching instances themselves. This incorrectly prompted them to restart in an attempt to remediate the issue but instead prompted them to reject live traffic. The upstream data access service, which depends on these caches, in turn was forced to route additional traffic to our databases, resulting in increased latency and potential timeouts.\n\nIn this case, the impacted caching instances were contained to a single GCP availability zone. We eventually remediated this issue by using newly-developed tooling to divert all Box traffic from the degraded zone until the affected caching instances were manually restored by on-call engineers. However, this went unnoticed during the initial investigation as engineers pursued remediating the problems within the caching tier, which increased time to remediation.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Changing the underlying behavior that led to improperly triggering VM recreation and adding additional controls to ensure successful initialization.\n* Implementing changes to ensure that leader election for this management service guarantees that a healthy server is discoverable.\n* Adding observability to diagnose failures contained to a single AZ and improve processes to more quickly employ a zonal drain.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps taken to keep them from happening again.\n\nBetween 01:39 AM PT and 05:19 AM PT on March 12, 2025, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, Box customers were unable to open or edit Microsoft Office files via Office Online. The issue occurred as a result of network connectivity issues with Microsoft's services. We were able to resolve the issue by restoring the network connectivity with our partner. In addition, we are working on making the Box For Office Integration more resilient to prevent similar problems in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe Box For Office Integration enhances communication with Microsoft servers, enabling Office Online functionalities for files hosted in Box. This communication occurs through the Web Application Open Platform Interface \\(WOPI\\) protocol. Most WOPI operations require a process called WOPI discovery. During this phase, a WOPI host \\(like Box\\), identifies how to perform specific actions within the WOPI protocol. In this case, it is performed by retrieving a discovery XML file from Microsoft's Discovery Endpoint. This file contains essential information about the URLs needed for these actions and the keys required for validating signatures on each WOPI command. The file is then cached for a set period. \n\nBefore the outage that caused this issue, one of the discovery endpoints in Office Online faced significant slowdowns and longer response times than usual. At the same time, Box's cache expired, which prevented us from managing WOPI operations effectively. As a result, users may have experienced session terminations and disruption of the integration between the two services. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* The cache time-to-live for the discovery file will be increased to minimize Box's exposure to potential failures in reaching the discovery endpoint.\n* The discovery file will be periodically refreshed by a dedicated process. This approach aims to offload the operational endpoint, thereby minimizing its exposure to potential issues during periods of degradation.\n* The operations timeout will be reduced to enhance overall performance.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Box public APIs, Shared Links and Box Notes. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 11:18 AM and 12:15 PM PST on Feb 19th, 2025, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this period, there was a noticeable degradation in the following services: Public API, Login, Box Sign, Shared Links, and Notes.  Due to a gap in the procedure related to the management of application authentication keys, this led to a deletion of keysets that were mistakenly believed to be no longer necessary.  The impact of this was detected through a drop in Box’s User Availability metrics at 11:15am PST and by 11:52am PST. This drop was traced to the operation of the deletion of these keys. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe deleted key is important for token-based authentication between the application and the database which stores security rules to validate Box upstream services.  The deletion of this key caused the authentication failure of the application with the database and prohibited the application from executing properly.  Additionally, after reviewing our protocol around customer awareness of issues, we realize that our timeliness goal for posting to our Status site was not met.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Migrate application authorization to a centralized authentication process / service.\n* Limit visibility of application account key read/write access on the administrator console.\n* Update necessary runbooks with correct procedures.\n* Review and streamline Status posting events to ensure timely and consistent communication.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Box services. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, between 5:00 PM PST and 7:00 PM PST, Box conducted a planned zonal resilience test as part of ongoing efforts to enhance system reliability. During the test, all traffic from one active service zone was diverted to other healthy zones. As a result, some users may have experienced slowness, login failures, or other difficulties while using Box. The impact lasted until 7:04 PM PST, extending four minutes beyond the planned maintenance window. During the test, some backend services experienced temporary overloading, making the impact more severe than anticipated. We mitigated the issue by redistributing traffic across all active zones.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nDuring a planned zonal resilience test, all traffic from one active service zone was diverted to other zones. However, one zone unexpectedly experienced a disproportionate increase in traffic compared to the others. While the backend services in that zone generally had enough capacity to handle the load, a cache instance became overloaded due to a key that was accessed significantly more than others. This overload triggered a ripple effect, impacting database health, which in turn caused requests to pile up at the Edge layer, ultimately leading to request rejections. During the test, we successfully identified and root-caused the issue, mitigating it by ending the test and redistributing traffic more evenly across all active zones.\n\nThe issue revealed the following areas of improvements:\n\n* Insufficient monitoring for single-instance failures during resilience testing.\n* Uneven traffic distribution among zones, leading to localized overload.\n* Lack of mechanisms to detect and prevent key issues from overloading cache instances.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Enhancing zonal resilience mechanics to ensure more balanced traffic distribution during a zonal failure.\n* Improving monitoring to detect single-instance failures more effectively during resilience testing.\n* Optimizing cache access patterns to prevent key issues from overloading cache instances.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Box Logins and Webapp. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 3:52pm PST and 5:10pm PST on January 15th, 2025, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some of the load balancers taking customer traffic suffered from memory exhaustion leading to users experiencing intermittent issues logging in to Box and connecting to the Box Webapp. The issue occurred due to a latent memory exhaustion problem in some of our public load balancer instances and was exacerbated by peak traffic levels. We were able to resolve the issue by performing a rolling restart of the affected instances and increasing the available load balancer instances to support peak traffic levels. In addition, we are working on improving our observability into the latent memory issues and previously unknown signals on these systems to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nStarting at 5:30am PST on January 15th, some external load balancer instances which are responsible for routing all customer traffic started to exhaust their shared memory allocation. This happened due to organic traffic growth and an increase in the number of backends to which the load balancers were proxying traffic. While the overall memory of these systems remained at an acceptable level throughout the incident window, the shared memory zone was not tracked as a separate metric; as a result, the team was not alerted to this resource exhaustion. As the day went on and traffic levels increased, at 3:52pm PST these instances started to experience intermittent problems passing traffic to their backends, which led to customers experiencing intermittent errors or slowdowns when accessing Box, \\(including logins as well as the Webapp\\). Once the problem was identified during the investigation, we performed a rolling restart of the affected load balancer instances and increased the number of available instances. As a result of these efforts, overall site health was immediately improved and was considered recovered at 5:10pm PST.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Improving our tracking and alerting on shared memory zone utilization \\[DONE\\]\n* Improving external test coverage as well as internal SLO baselines\n* Automating process for rolling reloads or restarts across the load balancing fleet\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the current state and we may update as more information is confirmed.\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\nWe recently addressed issues affecting the Box for Salesforce and Box for NetSuite integrations. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 2:28 AM PT and 8:42 AM PT on Thursday, November 21, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while using Box for Salesforce or Box for NetSuite integrations. During this time, a small subset of customers were unable to use Box Embed Widget components in some of their Box for Salesforce integrations and, to a lesser extent, the Box for NetSuite v1 integration. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change released to some enterprises in our ongoing effort to improve performance and stability. We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back this change**.** In addition, we are working to improve our testing processes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\n‌\n\nWe are working on refactoring and modernizing the Box Embed codebase. As part of this process we released updated code to a small percentage of client enterprises. After the release, it was discovered that some components of our Salesforce Integration \\(Box Lightning Components\\) and an older version of our Oracle NetSuite Integration \\(V1\\) were using endpoints that were not compatible with this update. Given that the code was only released to a subset of users and only some of them were using these specific integrations, it took some time before the issue could be detected and resolved.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Working on improved monitoring for the services affected.\n* Working on updates to legacy endpoints affected by the code change.\n* Improved testing procedures for Box Embed releases and the services affected.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, some users encountered an error when attempting to open PowerPoint files with Box For Office Online. The issue occurred as a result of a recent Microsoft Office update that was being gradually rolled out to users by Microsoft. We were able to resolve the issue by working closely with Microsoft to identify the cause of the issue; once Microsoft’s engineering team reverted the update, our service was restored. In addition, we are working to enhance monitoring and escalation channels with Microsoft to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\nWe are conducting a full engineering postmortem and our overview is subject to change with further analysis and findings. In the event our continuing investigation yields further substantive findings, we may publish additional analysis after the conclusion of the full engineering postmortem.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

In addition, we have improved our monitoring processes and implemented new monitors to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nStarting October 10 2024 1:34am PST, an unusual sequence of customer activity occurred that put load on multiple backend systems and hence resulting in the degradation. Various applications were scaled up in the process to support the increased load. \n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Scaled up various applications to support the increased load.\n* Evaluate changes required to prevent this from happening again.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn September 29, 2024, between 10:55 PM PDT and 11:33 PM PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have experienced difficulties in performing login operations and file uploads/downloads. This issue occurred as a result of a recent software change in our ongoing effort to improve performance and stability. We were able to resolve the issue by increasing the scaling of a feature toggle management service. In addition, we are working to improve our release strategy to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nBefore the incident, we had identified an issue with autoscaling of our feature toggle management service and prepared a change in four major applications. The change was inadvertently pushed simultaneously across all regions and instances. The simultaneous restarts of the applications caused a temporary slowdown in the affected applications ability to process all of the load in a timely manner resulting increased timeout errors across Box’s products.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Adjust release strategy for feature toggle management service to ensure a more gradual rollout\n* Investigate platform configuration to decrease application start-up time during release rollouts\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time, Box Drive & Box Sync were slow in recognizing that documents had been updated by other users and a new copy was needed. The issue occurred because a new software release introduced unexpected latency in a processing pipeline used in propagating update notifications.

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Box KeySafe. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn Thursday, August 29, 2024, between 1:48am and 3:38am PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some Box KeySafe customers experienced difficulty uploading new content to Box, as well as downloading content. Additionally, some customers encountered issues with Microsoft office co-authoring feature. The incident began due to a network connectivity issue within our cloud vendor that impacted Identity and Access Management \\(IAM\\) and access to Key Management Service \\(KMS\\). This caused a backup in requests to some of the Box services involved with Microsoft Co-Authoring. We were able to resolve the issue once normal operation with our cloud vendor was restored. In addition to implementing the recommended customer actions from the vendor-provided RCA, we're also working to enhance the resiliency of our system in related areas and improve visibility through health checks to detect and prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nA cloud vendor network incident disrupted Box's communication with Key Management Service \\(KMS\\) instances, affecting upload and download operations for KeySafe customers. This triggered a cascading effect, as requests accumulated on a backend service involved in Microsoft Office co-authoring. The increased workload on this service's Istio-proxy container led to memory and CPU spikes, causing DNS resolution errors and latency issues. These problems further hampered Microsoft Office co-authoring requests, creating a cycle of retries and failures.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Using regional STS endpoints as recommended by our cloud vendor’s RCA of this issue.\n* Implementing additional health checks for the impacted backend service.\n* Enhancing connection handling of the impacted backed service to prevent excessive queueing.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween July 21, 2024, 3:00 PM PT and July 22, 2024, 2:00 AM PT, some users may have observed that some Relay workflows were delayed. \n\n**Analysis** \n\nRelay workflows are executed on a shared pool of compute resources. This issue occurred because the system was under unusually high load, which delayed the execution of some workflows. We were able to resolve the issue by rebalancing resources across outstanding workflows.\n\nWe are currently enhancing our monitoring and notification systems to ensure that engineers receive timely alerts about resource allocation issues. Additionally, we are focusing on improving our tools for rebalancing resources in order to proactively prevent similar issues from happening again in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Automatic recognition of workflow causing peak load and optimizing resource utilization.\n* Reducing time to action by improving engineering troubleshooting steps to diagnose and detect resource allocation issues that cause delays.\n* Improve internal tooling to allow quicker intervention for on-support specialists.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 2:15 PM and 2:30 PM PDT on June 25, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box Notes. During this time, users would have seen an error banner indicating that the system was reconnecting and, upon reconnecting, some of the users’ recent edits may have been reverted. The issue occurred as a result of a code change enabling values to be written to cache on the Notes servers unintentionally. We were able to resolve the issue by disabling the code that the change was applied to and updating it to no longer write to cache. In addition, we are working to improve the resiliency of our system in the related areas as well as gain higher visibility through logging to detect and prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred because a process that reads values from the Notes database and caches them in memory on the Notes server was unintentionally enabled on servers not taking live traffic \\(passive\\). Meanwhile, servers taking live traffic \\(active\\) were allowed to make updates to those values in the Notes database. However, the values in cache on the passive servers were not updated or cleared. When traffic was redirected to the passive servers, those stale values were returned from cache causing a mismatch in what was returned by the server and what was expected by clients. Clients attempted to send updates to the servers to correct the mismatch, but a bug in the client caused the updates to be invalid and rejected by the servers. This resulted in an error banner being shown and the client being unable to recover from the mismatch.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Update code to prevent process from running on passive servers\n* Update code to clear values from cache when servers transition from passive to active\n* Fix client bug causing invalid updates to be sent to server\n* Add logging to detect when values are returned from cache unintentionally\n* Improve developer documentation to prevent similar changes from being made in the future\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.\n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 9:38am and 9:50am on June 25th, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have encountered issues uploading and downloading files as well as retrieving results from our events API. The issue occurred as a result of an unexpected upstream failure in our database infrastructure that did not recover automatically. We were able to resolve the issue by manually triggering a failover operation of the impacted database and verifying successful completion of transactions after failover. In addition, we identified and fixed a bug in our database remediation tools that prevented our automated failover process from completing quickly for this type of failure.  We are constantly testing our automated failover processes and working to improve any shortcomings as they are identified to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred due to a failure in our database remediation service using a suboptimal upstream API to recreate failed database nodes under certain conditions.  In order to ensure data integrity, our database remediation service paused further actions and escalated to our team to review the issue, at which point our engineers validated that a manual failover operation was the correct operation to restore service.  Our team consulted with the upstream vendor to identify a methodology that would ensure the database remediation service would succeed for all classes of unexpected database node failures.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Implement fixes to database remediation service to always succeed at recreating failed database nodes during unexpected failures.\n* Increase retries in database remediation service when unexpected failures occur to ensure automated failover succeeds.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

The issue occurred due to a change in a query pattern coming into the system that caused increased load on the search backend. We were able to resolve the issue by adding additional capacity to the search backends. In addition, we are working on updating our resource allocation to prevent load on a few search backend nodes from affecting other nodes.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOn June 14, some search nodes received a change in a query pattern that caused high load. This led to increased query latency and query failures, which eventually impacted users of Search. We were able to add more query nodes to handle the higher load. On June 17, the query pattern re-occurred with increased volume. In the second occurrence, we were able to again address the increased volume with additional capacity. We are reconfiguring resource allocation in the search backend nodes to better handle changes to query patterns. In addition, we’re working on solutions to prevent added load on a few nodes from cascading.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Increase resources/right size clusters\n* Optimize resource utilization to better handle the new query pattern\n* Isolate search nodes to ensure better quality of service to all users\n* Decrease the amount of time it takes to add new resources\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 12:13 AM and 2:55 AM PDT on June 14, 2024 and between 8:04 AM and 10:44 AM PDT on June 17, 2024, some users may have experienced slow or failed Search queries while working in Box. The issue occurred due to a change in a query pattern coming into the system that caused increased load on the search backend. We were able to resolve the issue by adding additional capacity to the search backends. In addition, we are working on updating our resource allocation to prevent load on a few search backend nodes from affecting other nodes.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOn June 14, some search nodes received a change in a query pattern that caused high load. This led to increased query latency and query failures, which eventually impacted users of Search. We were able to add more query nodes to handle the higher load. On June 17, the query pattern re-occurred with increased volume. In the second occurrence, we were able to again address the increased volume with additional capacity. We are reconfiguring resource allocation in the search backend nodes to better handle changes to query patterns. In addition, we’re working on solutions to prevent added load on a few nodes from cascading.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nBox has initiated the following corrective actions:\n\n* Increase resources/right size clusters\n* Optimize resource utilization to better handle the new query pattern\n* Isolate search nodes to ensure better quality of service to all users\n* Decrease the amount of time it takes to add new resources\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "_We recently addressed issues affecting Search. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future._\n\n \n\n_Between 9:33 pm PDT on June 3, 2024 and 1:28 pm PDT on June 4, 2024 and between 6:38 pm PDT and 7:52 pm PDT on June 6, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users were intermittently unable to query Search or receive Search results. This issue impacted a very small number \\(approximately 2%\\) of enterprises. During the first period, the issue occurred as a result of a partially rolled out recent code change. This code change was part of our ongoing effort to improve performance and stability. During the second period, the issue occurred a result of a latent bug in the Search Shadow service, which was used to investigate the root cause of the initial issue. We were able to resolve the issue by fully rolling back the change in both cases. In addition, we have added alerting to detect partial rollouts of changes as well as tests in pre-production environments and addressed the latent bug in the Search Shadow service to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future._ \n\n‌\n\n_Analysis_ \n\n_On June 3, 2024, Search released a change to how backend Search nodes are queried in order to improve performance and stability. This change had an unintended effect on query patterns that dramatically increased load for a small number of queries and only manifested at scale. Although the number of such queries was small, when a backend Search node processed them it would sporadically run out of memory and impact all traffic to that particular node. The Search release mechanism partially rolled out this change to a fraction of the fleet, but did not progress further. We initiated standard rollback procedures, but we did not detect that the change remained deployed on one of the nodes. This complicated the processes of diagnosing and mitigating the impact. The issue was mitigated when the partial rollback was detected and the change was fully rolled back._\n\n‌\n\n_On June 6, 2024, as part of the investigation to identify and verify the root cause of the initial issue, the Search team utilized a so-called Shadow service in production that does not service live traffic.  However, this Shadow service contained a latent bug that allowed a small percent of queries to be issued against the live backend Search nodes. Because the issue that occurred on June 3, 2024 could be triggered with just a handful of queries, the live serving nodes were inadvertently impacted by this Shadow service. The Shadow service change was rolled back to mitigate._\n\n‌\n\n‌\n\n_Corrective Actions_\n\n_The following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:_\n\n* _Improve release mechanisms and procedures to fully rollout or rollback changes in a bounded period of time_\n* _Add tooling and alerting to determine whether a change is fully or only partially deployed_\n* _Add additional tests to pre-production environments to detect unintended Search query pattern changes that sporadically increase load on backend Search nodes_\n* _Fix latent bug in Shadow service and add additional monitoring to detect queries being routed incorrectly to live backend Search nodes_\n\n‌\n\n_We are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter._ \n\n \n\n_Sincerely,_\n\n_The Box Team_",

Over the course of this period, there were several 60-90 second time intervals when logins and various other functionality was impaired. This issue occurred due to a recent change in our token rotation process as part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the security of our systems. We resolved the problem by overriding the process and updating the expired tokens. Additionally, we are actively working on improving our testing procedures to prevent similar issues from happening again in the future.\n\n‌\n\nWe are conducting a full engineering postmortem and our overview is subject to change with further analysis and findings. In the event our continuing investigation yields further substantive findings, we may publish additional analysis after the conclusion of the full engineering postmortem.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, some Box customers might have experienced elevated error rate or increased latency with Box API requests. The issue occurred due to an unexpected failure during a MySQL Instance failover that was executed in response to high load on one of the database instances. We were able to resolve the issue by manually executing the instance failover. In addition, we have implemented a new discovery mechanism that improves the time to detect and propagate a MySQL topology change to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nDuring the incident, a failover was executed for a MySQL leader that had high CPU usage. The failover process failed to propagate the topology change and caused the impact to Box API success rate. The issue was remediated by executing the rest of the failover steps manually and the impact recovered once the new topology was successfully propagated to other components. The root cause of high CPU usage was later determined to be organic increase in week over week traffic and the impacted instance was upsized to add more CPU cores.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* The Database instance that had high CPU Usage was scaled up to add more CPU cores\n* Additionally, we are looking into remapping the Database instances to normalize the load on the impacted instance.\n* A MySQL Topology Discovery mechanism that significantly improves time to detect and propagate topology updates has been rolled out.

During this time, some users might have not been able to access Box Notes. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change in our ongoing effort to improve user experience and stability of our application. We were able to resolve the issue by releasing a missing configuration value in production. In addition, we are working to improve our safety and efficiency of our release process to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\n‌\n\nThe code change responsible for the issue in object was caused by a missing configuration value in production settings. As a result, all instances of Notes using the new version image were unable to open and experienced downtime.\n\n‌\n\nDuring this incident, we identified certain gaps that contributed to this issue or resulted in longer-than-normal remediation, all of which we are working to address. First, this issue exposed a gap in our validation process for production configurations either before deployment or during server startup. Additionally, this issue did not trigger any alerts and was not visible through tracked metrics like SLO and UA graphs, which resulted in a lack of visibility of this issue. Finally, the deployment process for Notes servers does not allow for immediate rollbacks due to statefulset rollout taking approximately 45 minutes to complete, and our current incremental deployment process leaves us without a fully safe data center option as fallback.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Implementing production setting configuration safety improvements to reduce the likelihood of similar issues occurring again in the future.\n* Creating alerts on client-side JS errors to improve alerting and visibility of such issues.\n* Improving Notes incremental release safety to improve our deployment processes and facilitate more effective remediation of issues with deployments.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future. On April 1, 2024, between 5:27PM PT and 6:31PM PT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have experienced higher than normal latency and/or timeouts when accessing certain subsets of Box Sign, Shield and Metadata functionality.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue occurred as a result of a configuration change that caused resource exhaustion during peak traffic load. We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back the change, and scaling up the impacted services to handle traffic backlogs. We’ve updated our deployment processes and documentation to better reflect the risk from peak traffic for changes similar to the one in this case.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* We updated deployment processes and documentation for similar changes\n* We’ve enhanced monitoring and alerts for the impacted services\n* We’re continuing to tune resource allocation and timeout configurations to prevent similar issues in the future\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 2:41 AM and 2:51 PM PDT on March 26, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box Sign. During this time, the users were unable to send manual reminders for pending Sign requests, and delete sign requests in the WebApp. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred as a result of a recent code change made to improve Box Sign functionality. The issue presented itself in the sign mechanism for request handling, resulting in the sign reminder and delete functionalities not being available to the users. Incomplete automated testing coverage and pre-release checks for the functionalities mentioned above allowed the issue to go undetected before production deployment. We were able to quickly resolve the issue by performing a rollback of the sign web service. In addition, we are working on improving our monitoring system, pre-release quality check procedures, engineering on-call documentation and the robustness of the sign request handling mechanism to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Enhancing monitoring and alerts graphs in the sign service\n* Increasing the integration test coverage of the area affected in the incident \\(and adjacent ones\\)\n* Updating the sign engineering on-call documentation, as part of the effort to facilitate the improvement of detection and resolution time\n* Improving the robustness of the sign request handling mechanism\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time, queries made to Box AI returned an error. The issue occurred due to a change to a load balancing configuration for one of our endpoints used for Box AI, which resulted in unexpected credential issues. We were able to resolve the issue by fixing the configuration and improving the resiliency of our system. In addition, we have increased alerting and implemented more monitoring and logging to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nAt Box, we are always striving to improve the efficiency and fault tolerance of our services. The AI team implemented a change to resolve latency issues in our services. A misconfiguration in this change temporarily resulted in AI query failures, which we were able to resolve by identifying and addressing the problematic configuration settings. Additionally, the issue revealed some gaps in our alerting and testing systems, as well as gaps in our internal team process, both of which impacted remediation time.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Add in more alerting and automated processes to prevent future complications\n* Improve observability by adding in more logs, metrics and tracing throughout the system.\n* Improve testing reliability by making testing environments mirror production environments.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 1:00PM PT and 1:40PM PT on March 7, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users were not able to access files stored in Box folders. The issue occurred as a result of a deployment of a data access service in our ongoing effort to improve the scalability of Box’s infrastructure. While deploying this service, a central control plane component became overloaded and was unable to propagate new data access instance information to the applications. We were able to resolve the issue by scaling up the control plane component. In addition, we are working to over-provision the control plane component and improve the monitoring and alerting to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nBox utilizes a communication layer called \"Service Mesh\" to facilitate effective communication between its services. However, a recent increase in the number of applications onboarded to Service Mesh caused the control plane component to become overloaded, resulting in delays propagating instance changes for impacted services. Before the incident occurred, several core applications underwent deployment simultaneously, including the Data Access Service. Unfortunately, the control plane failed to promptly propagate instance changes for this service. Since most user interactions with Box rely on connecting with the Data Access Service, users were unable to access files stored in Box folders during this time due to the propagation delay.\n\n‌\n\nTo address this issue and prevent future occurrences of control plane overload, we have scaled up its capacity by three times and implemented improved monitoring and alerting mechanisms.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Scaling up control plane capacity to prevent future overload issues. \n* Enhancing monitoring and alerting for the control plane status. \n* Conduct benchmark and scalability testing of the control plane in Pre-Prod environment. \n* Arrange detailed sessions with our technology vendor to optimize Box's Service Mesh infrastructure.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting file and folder counts in Box. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 4:00 PM PST on February 18, 2024 and 9:10 PM PST on February 19, 2024, updates to file and folder counts displayed in Box were delayed for some customers. The issue occurred as a result of an intentional workload migration to mitigate a partial outage in one region of one of our cloud providers.  We were able to resolve the issue by adding resources to the target region to reduce the cross-region latency impact. These delays only affected the visibility of file and folder counts; the counts themselves were maintained.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOn February 16th, a resource migration from one of our regions to another was performed as a mitigation effort for an unrelated issue. An increase in traffic on February 18th combined with the region shift resulted in a backlog in the file and folder counts workflow.\n\nWe addressed the issue by adding more resources to the new region. We are currently in the process of further consolidating the resources for this workflow to avoid significant delays and backlogs. Furthermore, to minimize the likelihood of similar situations occurring again, we are implementing checks and alerts to prevent future scenarios in which resource shortages could lead to delays in updating file and folder counts.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* We will implement checks and alerts to trigger if the workflow processing slows down and starts to back up.\n* We will add further documentation to our run book as references to be used in the event of similar region outages, ensuring that our service remains resilient to such incidents.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time, an internal service was restarted, which resulted in some users experiencing degraded performance and/or intermittent errors on Box Uploads, Downloads and Public API. The issue occurred as a result of a previous infrastructure change and was automatically resolved once the impacted service successfully restarted and stabilized. We are enhancing our deployment automation and defining additional processes to minimize the risk of similar issues occurring in the future. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOn January 22, 2024, a change was rolled out on an availability zone in one of our primary regions in which an internal database interaction service was running. There was a pre-existing discrepancy between the code and infrastructure originating from a previous operation performed in response to an unrelated incident. This discrepancy resulted in the impacted service restarting, which caused some users to experience degraded performance. \n\nWhen the change went live, the availability of the service dropped. That caused traffic from downstream services that directed to the service fleet in this zone to fail. As a result the top level metrics were impacted for 10 minutes. The impacted service came back up shortly after, which remediated the issue.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Enhancing automation to prevent disruptive changes from going live\n* Putting processes and internal SLAs in place that will eliminate discrepancies between our code and infrastructure\n* Adding measures in our codebase to reduce the chances of causing disruptions  \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future._\n\nBetween 02:48 AM and 04:06AM PT on January 18, 2024, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, Box customers were unable to open or edit Microsoft Office files via Office Online. The issue occurred as a result of network connectivity issues. We were able to resolve the issue by restoring the network connectivity. In addition, we are working to make the Office Online integration more resilient to such failures, to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\nAnalysis \n\nThe Office Online integration communicates with Microsoft servers in order to provide Office for the Web capabilities for files hosted in Box. This communication happens via the Web Application Open Platform Interface \\(WOPI\\) protocol.\n\nBox performs signature validation of each WOPI command it receives. The cryptographic keys needed to perform this validation are acquired through a process called WOPI discovery. During the discovery process, Box fetches an XML file from the Microsoft servers. This file contains the keys needed to perform signature validation. The file is then cached for a period of time.\n\nPrior to the outage, the discovery endpoint for one of the Office Online environments became briefly unreachable. At the same time, the cache on the Box side expired. Box then failed to refetch the discovery XML for one of the environments, which caused the signature validation to fail in a cascading way across all other environments.\n\n‌\n\nCorrective Actions\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* The cache time-to-live for the discovery file will be increased, to reduce Box’s exposure to any failures to reach the discovery endpoint\n* Changes will be made to ensure that failures to acquire discovery information for one Office Online environment do not impact other environments\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn January 9, 2024, between 11:10 AM PT and 12:15 PM PT, users experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users experienced slowness and failures interacting with most parts of the Box webapp and public API, including Logins, Uploads and Downloads. The issue was triggered by a change that impacted Kubernetes clusters in one of the regions where we run our critical services. At 11:18 AM PT this change was rolled back. After rolling back the change, systems began to recover around 11:27 AM. \n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOn January 9th, 2024, we made a configuration change to deploy a new daemonset to the dedicated Kubernetes clusters running our core data services, which caused resource exhaustion and eviction of our core data services on those nodes. The daemonset deployment pipeline erroneously allowed the change to be promoted to an entire region instead of the planned gradual rollout, which resulted in service interruption impacting most of our customers. To address this issue, we rolled back the daemonset deployment. After the daemonset was rolled back, the evicted core data services began to be restored and our systems began to recover; however, in two of our three clusters, this process was delayed by a scheduler limitation, elongating the duration of impact. We adjusted the resource requests for our core data services to speed up recovery of these two clusters, restoring normal operations at 12:15pm.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* We have paused the daemonset pipeline until we can ensure it employs safe incremental rollout processes.\n* We are updating the daemonset pipeline to validate resource allocations before deployment and ensure a gradual production rollout to reduce the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future.\n* We have adjusted the priority of our application services, including the core data services, to be higher than daemonsets to ensure their capacity is protected.\n* We are adjusting our Kubernetes configurations to enable faster restoration of service through guaranteed capacity and buffers.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.\n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "## Background\n\nOn December 15, 2023 Box experienced a severe service degradation. During this time, users experienced slowness and failures interacting with all parts of the Box webapp and public API; including Logins, Uploads and Downloads. Additionally, some customers might have seen small subsets of their content created during the incident become sporadically hidden. \n\n‌\n\nThe issue was triggered by a partial power loss that impacted persistent disks in one of the cloud infrastructure availability zones in which we operate, leading to multiple active databases being impacted. Although our database infrastructure is architected with zonal redundancy, the unique nature of the failure surfaced a gap in our zonal health monitoring and presented unforeseen challenges for our automatic recovery tooling, extending the resolution time. We were ultimately able to resolve the issue by manually shifting traffic out of the impacted availability zone. \n\n## Analysis\n\nBox’s database infrastructure is designed to be able to withstand problems impacting a single availability zone. Our database replicas are spread across multiple availability zones for redundancy and we have automated tooling in place that can detect faults and shift traffic to other replicas should that become necessary. Both the redundant replicas and automated tooling are exercised regularly as part of our normal operations.\n\n‌\n\nIn this case, when the partial power loss took place, it impacted several of our databases in a way that compromised their ability to serve high traffic volumes. Diagnosing this type of partial zonal failure was challenging due to the high variability of impact across multiple databases. Because of this unique confluence of factors, the root cause proved challenging to diagnose and mitigate both for our automation and incident responders, extending time to resolution. Once we confirmed the impact was limited to a single availability zone, we were able to effectively mitigate all active databases out of the impacted zone by leveraging other availability zones.\n\n‌\n\nDuring the course of our mitigation efforts, replication topologies may have caused certain newly created files or file versions to intermittently not appear in a limited number of Box accounts. These intermittent visibility issues were resolved as replication topologies were normalized and caches were later cleared. \n\n## Next Steps and Corrective Actions\n\nWe are continuing to conduct a comprehensive engineering postmortem.  Therefore, this report is subject to change based on our further analysis and findings.\n\n‌\n\nThe following corrective actions have been, or continue to be, implemented:\n\n* improve our ability to diagnose partial availability zone degradations like the one we encountered in this incident;\n* improve our automatic incident mitigation system to better handle partial zone degradations;\n* improve our testing strategies for the database tier mitigation systems to cover this type of failure scenario; and\n* conduct a comprehensive audit of our production systems to validate their resilience to zonal failures and degradations.\n\n‌\n\nThe above noted corrective actions will strengthen our efforts to safeguard against partial zone degradations, reduce mitigation timeframes and support enhanced testing and prevention efforts.  \n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "## Background\n\nWe recently addressed issues affecting Box Webapp, Public and Uploads & Downloads. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future. \n\nBetween 4:30 AM PST and 5:05 AM PST on December 15, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During these times, some users may have experienced slowness and failures interacting  with parts of the Box Webapp and public API, including Uploads and Downloads. The issue occurred due to an issue with the deployment of a new DB Access Control service on our database fleet.  We were able to resolve the issue by temporarily disabling the problematic service. In addition, we are working to improve our testing and rollout process for services being deployed to our database fleet to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe DB Access Control service is a service that enables new user access controls to be applied automatically and frequently.  This allows for faster development of new DB functionality that requires access control changes, resulting in faster team velocity and ultimately more stable and reliable infrastructure.  \n\nOn the morning of December 13th, an operator started the rollout of the DB Access Control service by deploying it to a single database pod. At that time, it was configured to execute its work every 10 minutes.  Approximately 10 minutes after the deployment, we saw degradation on that pod, causing the impact seen on December 13. The operator suspected that the service frequency was the cause and remediated by configuring the service to execute its work once a day at a low-traffic time. The next steps should have been to validate the changes in a way that would not result in customer impact and then deploy it again on a single pod. However, the standard process was unintentionally not adhered to in this case and the change was instead deployed across the fleet, leading to additional impact as seen on December 15.\n\nIn addition to optimizing the DB Access Control service to be less resource-intensive, we intend to make some process changes in response to this issue. There is already a general standard process that should be followed when deploying services to the Database fleet. However, to minimize the likelihood of similar situations occurring again, we are updating our documentation to better ensure that all operators have a comprehensive understanding of the standard process and that such process is consistently followed. \n\n## Next Steps and Corrective Actions\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* The relevant DB service was temporarily disabled to remediate the issue.\n* The relevant DB service has been optimized to be less resource-intensive and will automatically refuse to run during high-traffic times\n* Rollout process for all DB services will be more thoroughly documented\n* Operators will receive additional training to ensure that they have a comprehensive understanding of the documented rollout process\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed an issue affecting multi-factor authentication logins. We would like to further explain the issue and action items we had taken to prevent it from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 9:00 AM PST and 12:30 PM PST on November 6, 2023, some users experienced latency and difficulty logging into Box. During this time, users logging in to Box with multi-factor authentication may have encountered slow responses or failures during the login process. Upon investigation, we determined that the cause of this issue was the result of a single enterprise repeatedly retrying programmatic session termination calls for all its users, which temporarily overburdened the multi-factor authentication service. The issue was resolved when the user was temporarily prevented from using the session termination API.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe issue occurred due a confluence of factors relating to our session termination API and multi-factor authentication service. Specifically, at the time of this issue, our session termination API did not have a rate limiter in place, which allowed a customer to repeatedly call the API with an excessive number of requests to the multi-factor authentication service. The multi-factor-authentication service additionally did not rate-limit the specific call made to it by the session termination API. Finally, the internal retry logic for timed-out requests continued to load the multi-factor authentication service. As a result, due to the unusually high session termination calls, our multi-factor authentication service became overburdened and resulted in the temporary impact to users.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Adding rate limits to the session termination API and the multi-factor authentication service.\n* Enhancing dashboard and alerts related to session termination API and multi-factor authentication.\n* Optimization of the logic between the session termination API and multi-factor authentication service to improve throughput.\n* Investigation of retry logic to prevent perpetuating overload situations.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter. \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, customers using the integration experienced issues loading the Box Folder widgets, toolkit automation, and authentication flows. This occurred as a result of a back-end change that resulted in the integration's authentication credentials being invalidated. We were able to resolve the issue by resetting the credentials. In addition, we are updating our change control processes and software to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n‌\n\n**Analysis** \n\n‌\n\nThe Box Developer Console is part of our main web application, and is an interface that developers use to manage their application’s properties. The console also includes functionality to reset application credentials when necessary, which is typically reserved for credential rotations or similar scenarios. In this issue, the functionality to reset the application credentials was inadvertently triggered during other, more routine updates. As a result of these invalidated credentials, some users may have temporarily experienced difficulties using the integration. The issue was detected by Box employees within minutes of the change, and we were able to resolve the issue by restoring the application’s credentials.\n\n‌\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Restoring the Box for Salesforce integration’s credentials\n* Update tooling and processes so that routine, low risk updates to applications are separated from rare, but necessary high risk capabilities, like resetting application credentials.\n\n‌\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.
