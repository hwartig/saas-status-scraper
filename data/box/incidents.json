To the best of our knowledge, this is the current state and we may update as more information is confirmed._ \n\n \n\nOn July 03, 2023 between 12:10am PT and 01:02am PT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, users may have experienced errors or slowness when accessing [Box.com](http://Box.com), Public API, Box Sign and SSO services. The issue occurred due to our system connection limits being exceeded under high load causing them to be unavailable for new connections. We were able to resolve the issue by diverting traffic away from impacted machines. In addition, we are removing those connection limits to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\nâ\n\nWe are conducting a full engineering postmortem and our overview is subject to change with further analysis and findings. In the event our continuing investigation yields further substantive findings, we may publish additional analysis after the conclusion of the full engineering postmortem.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.Â \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

In addition**,** we are working on upgrading our deployment pipeline to prevent incomplete deployments in the future.\n\nWe are conducting a full engineering postmortem and our overview is subject to change with further analysis and findings. In the event our continuing investigation yields further substantive findings, we may publish additional analysis after the conclusion of the full engineering postmortem.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 2:04 PM PDT and 10:32 PM PDT on June 7, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users may have received partial or no results in response to file searches. The issue occurred due to an underlying infrastructure issue where a Search cluster was missing a portion of its index. We were able to resolve the issue by immediately routing traffic to one of our backup clusters. In addition, we are working to add restrictions and additional checks to better prevent traffic from being routed to an incomplete index in the future.Â \n\nâ\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOn June 7th, we performed commands while troubleshooting a separate issue that inadvertently caused a Search cluster to serve customer traffic while missing a portion of its index. This resulted in some customer search queries returning with partial or no results. To remediate this issue, we routed traffic to one of our backup clusters.\n\nâ\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Applying checks and restrictions to prevent actions that could result in an empty search index\n* Using automation to perform further checks and restrictions\n* Improving our alerting to catch situations where traffic is routed to an incomplete index\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

During this time, people using the Box webapp may have experienced increased latency or slowness. The issue occurred because of an erroneous change which constricted the amount of effective hardware capacity for the service dedicated to processing our webapp traffic. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the this change. In addition, we are improving our processes and observability techniques to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n**Analysis**\n\nOn Friday, May 12, 2023, we deployed a change aimed at improving the processing efficiency of our webapp traffic. Although this change did not result in any observed issues over the weekend, as our traffic increased as APAC and EMEA customers came back to work on Monday morning, it became evident that the change was constricting the effective capacity of the service responsible for processing our webapp traffic. Once this issue was detected, we were able to diagnose the issue and the problematic change was reverted. This ultimately remediated the problem.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Adjusting our deployment processes to improve monitoring of changes during customer traffic peaks to better detect, diagnose and remediate such issues before customers are actually impacted.\n* The efficiency change that caused the problem has been re-thought and is now implemented in the way that is much less likely to cause any customer impact.\n\nâ\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.\n\nâ\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nÂ \n\nBetween 9am and 2pm PT on May 5th, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some requests to the Metadata Query API returned stale or outdated results. The issue occurred due to a delay in the replication of instance create and update events to the query datastore. We were able to resolve the issue by filtering out some events that were causing retries, dead lettering and hence delaying replication. In addition, we have identified the underlying pattern of events that was causing delays in the replication pipeline and patched our replication processing code to handle them gracefully, to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.Â \n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n**Analysis**Â \n\nWhen Metadata instances are mutated using the Box API or one of our applications, events containing the details of these mutations are emitted to a replication stream that is then processed by a pipeline without delay. This ensures the latest state is consistently available to be queried against using the Metadata Query API. We employ multiple optimizations to maintain the near-realtime characteristics of this query functionality, while ensuring all data is replicated consistently.\n\nâ\n\nDuring this incident, one of the optimizations we leverage encountered an unexpected pattern of data, causing it return errors and trigger retries. These retries slowed down processing of the replication stream, causing lag to grow and resulting in queries returning outdated information for some customers. After identifying and filtering out these events causing errors, we were able to get the replication pipeline to once again successfully process events without adding delay. We also increased the rate at which these replication events are processed, in order to recover from the lag that had built up and fully catch up.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Identified and patched for event pattern that caused errors and hence retries, ensuring graceful handling of unexpected data patterns.\n* Increased batch size for replication stream processing to prevent lag from building up and to enable faster recovery from any backlogs in the future.\n* Improved observability and increased sensitivity of alerts, to ensure faster detection of errors and/or lag build up.\n\nâ\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.Â \n\nÂ \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 11:15 pm PT on April 25, 2023 and 8:40 am PT on April 26, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, one of our cloud partners experienced an infrastructure malfunction that impacted one of their European regions. This impact caused the region to exhibit elevated error rates and increased request latency which caused upload and download requests in Box to backup. We were able to resolve this issue by updating storage policies in this European region to use a different but still compliant region. In addition we have taken on a number of near term and longer term remediations to to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.Â   \n  \n**Analysis**   \nStarting at approximately 7:00 pm PT on April 25, 2023 one of our European partners experienced an infrastructure problem in one availability zone of their France region. At 11:15 pm PT this malfunction triggered a fire that motivated an evacuation of datacenter personnel and resulted in region wide degradation. At this time requests that utilized storage in the impacted region saw increased latency and elevated error rates. This resulted in elevated request rates due to retries and longer request times. We remediated the issue by updating the storage policies to reroute the requests to another region that was still compliant with residency requirements, and by updating the behavior of internal retry and rate limiting logic.  \n  \n**Corrective Actions**  \nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Update internal rate limiting logic to trigger automatic scale-out sooner\n* Update monitoring for all storage locations\n* Audit request timeouts\n* Extend automated health checking and automated policy re-routing to cover additional degradation cases\n\n  \nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.Â \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting the Box Web App and public API. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nOn April 19, 2023 between 21:02 and 22:02 \\(Pacific Time\\),  some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, these users experienced slowness and intermittent failures interacting with certain parts of the Box Web App and public API, including Logins, Uploads and Downloads. The issue occurred as a result of an internal process overloading the database pod responsible for serving approximately 1% of our customers. We were able to resolve the issue by stopping the internal process that was stressing the database. In addition, we have already started the process of upsizing and splitting the database as part of our routine maintenance for busy database pods to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\nâ\n\n**Analysis**\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, the database pod on which this issue took place was identified as a candidate for splitting due to organic growth of the database. The split successfully completed in May 2022. In December 2022, the database pod was once again identified as a candidate for splitting due to additional organic growth since the previous split.  The second split kicked off in December and was estimated to complete in 8 weeks. However, a latent bug caused duplicate processing of some of the data on the pod; as a result, the split took longer than originally planned.  Load on the database pod continued to increase while the split was taking place and occasionally reached levels that were not sustainable, resulting in impact such as what was seen on April 19. While waiting for the split to be completed, the database pod was migrated onto more powerful hardware, providing some relief. The database split ultimately completed at the end of April 2022.\n\nâ\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improve our database split process to reduce duplicative processing, improve efficiency in performing splits, and better scoping completion timeline. \n\n* Identify even earlier database pods that require a database split\n\nâ\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.Â \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

During this time, some users experienced slowness and intermittent failures interacting with certain parts of the Box webapp and public API, including while applying Box Shield Classifications and sending documents for signature via Box Sign. The issue occurred as a result of a gradual new feature rollout that overwhelmed a cache held inside one of the key middleware services. We were able to resolve the issue by deploying a code change that prevented the feature rollout framework from overwhelming the cache and restarting the impacted service to clear the cache. In addition, we are working on improving monitoring and alerting around the impacted cache to be able to detect and address similar problems before they impact our users in the future.\n\nâ\n\n**Analysis** \n\nOur investigation shows that the incident was caused by an inefficient configuration of the experimentation framework that was used to begin gradual rollout of a new feature. This framework unexpectedly stored decision results in the cache, regarding whether the feature should be shown to the user. This decision storage overran the cache, causing other entries to be evicted. This meant that the web application ended up having to reconstitute the frequently used and expensive to compute information that would have ordinarily been in this cache. The effective capacity of our web application processing was thus dramatically reduced, which caused exhaustion and subsequent degradation of several of our latency sensitive services. The incident remediation was slowed down significantly by the lack of explicit alerting on the web application serverâs cache.\n\nâ\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Fix the experimentation framework such that it doesnât overwhelm the web application serverâs cache\n* Add explicit monitoring and alerting around the usage of the web application serverâs cache\n* Implement a fast way to clear the web application server caches on the entire server fleet\n* Add explicit monitoring and alerting around expensive operations performed by the web application server that should ordinarily be performed rarely due to being cached effectively\n\nâ\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Box Sign. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 11:00 AM PT and 1:21 PM PT on April 7, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, Box Sign users were unable to start the signing process using the upload new file feature. Users were presented with an error banner when uploading new documents. The issue occurred as a result of a recent code change made to standardize error code messages, which inadvertently impacted an internal interaction. We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back the relevant change. In addition, we have identified several corrective actions, detailed below, to minimize the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future.Â \n\nâ\n\n**Analysis** \n\nAs part of an effort to standardize error codes returned in API responses, we rolled out a change that updated some existing codes. This change impacted an internal interaction, in the Box Sign document upload flow, that was explicitly relying on a prior error code value. When the relevant error situation arose, the code was unable to detect and mitigate the recoverable error, resulting in it being propagated out to the end-user in the form of an error banner.\n\nâ\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Added additional tests to prevent modifications of existing error codes until it is deemed safe to do so.\n* Started the process to deprecate custom error code values, only keeping the standardized HTTP response codes.\n* Augmenting continuous end-to-end testing on pre-production environments for increased observability around critical user journeys.\n\nâ\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.Â \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 2:55am and 9:20am PDT on March 29th, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users may have experienced delays in Box Drive synchronizing changes. The issue occurred due to a regularly scheduled automatic internal credential rotation failing to propagate completely. We were able to resolve the issue by manually synchronizing the affected service with the latest credentials. In addition, we are ensuring services self-validate against the credential freshness constraints to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.Â \n\nâ\n\n**Analysis**\n\nKey rotation is one aspect of the broader key management and a component Boxâs overall security system, which requires key holders to update their keys regularly before they are revoked. In the event an automatic key rotation occurs and a key holder does not refresh their credentials within their valid lifetime they will no longer be able to authenticate and receive authorization to communicate with external systems. In the case of this issue, a single internal service responsible for managing realtime events did not update its credentials following an automatic rotation and thus not able to make those new events available to our customers.\n\nâ\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Add an alert to page on-call engineers should the affected service fail to update its credentials to enable a user to investigate and manually complete the task\n* Update the affected service to add an additional automatic check for credential freshness to watch for rotations and update automatically\n\nâ\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.Â \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting JWT logins and Box Notes. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 5:37 AM and 6:39 AM PT, 9:37 PM and 10:39 PM PT on March 21, 2023, and between 9:12 AM PT and 9:39 AM PT on March 22, 2023 some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, we noticed some JWT-based logins resulting in failures as well as an increase in disconnects within Box Notes while users tried to save or delete their Notes. The issue occurred because of a configuration change on one of our caching servers, specifically in one of our maintenance scripts. We were able to resolve the issue by quarantining the affected host and manually replacing it with a healthy one. In addition, we have hardened our automated checks, added better controls in these maintenance scripts and also improved observability on the impacted caching services in order to to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.Â \n\n  \n**Analysis** \n\nLogins at Box are rate limited in order to control the amount of traffic or requests that can be sent to our subsystems. During the time of the issue, the caching server that enables this rate limiting was shut down because of a misconfiguration in one of our maintenance scripts tasked with keeping our caching infrastructure up-to-date with the latest software patches. The script was trying to connect to its backend using an incorrect TLS certificate, causing the script to hang and consume system memory. Since this script runs on schedule, multiple instances of this script started over time causing it to consume more and more system resources.  Eventually, this led to insufficient resources being available for Memcached service, causing it to be terminated. Additionally, a bug in our auto-healing system prevented this caching server to be replaced with a healthy one leaving the server in service even though it was unhealthy. \n\nWhen part of the cache became unavailable, rate limiting service terminated the requests that were supposed to be cached in that server, causing approximately 30% of JWT logins to fail during that time. This same caching server was also used in the generation of OAuth2 tokens used internally within the BoxNotes service. When this cache would become unavailable, Box Notes would disconnect while trying to persist or delete a Note, since it could not validate the tokens. We noticed an increase of approximately 10% in the number of disconnects during the time of cache unavailability.\n\n  \n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Validate that all necessary TLS certificates are present on the entire caching fleet.\n* Fix the maintenance script so in case of a connection error, it terminates and does not hang and hold on to memory. \n* Fix the bug in the auto-healing system that prevented the unhealthy host from being replaced.\n* Add more specific alerts in case of failures like these, so on-call engineers are better informed.\n\n  \nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.Â \n\n  \nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nâ\n\nOn March 16th, 2023 between 4:30pm and 7:00pm PDT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users may have experienced higher than usual latencies and slightly elevated error rates when interacting with the Box website. The issue occurred due to a mistake made as part of a maintenance operation aimed at improving the efficiency and reliability of one of our foundational services. This maintenance operation resulted in fewer servers being left to serve the Box web application than were necessary to serve all incoming traffic without any customer impact. We were able to resolve the issue by restoring the necessary capacity for the impacted service. In addition, we are implementing autoscaling for this service to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\nâ\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe problem occurred over the course of a maintenance operation during which a legacy virtual-machine-based server fleet serving the Box web application was being replaced with a container-based fleet. Both fleets were sharing the load before the maintenance took place, and as the maintenance operation completed, only the container-based fleet remained. Although a load projection had been made prior to the maintenance and the container-based fleet was expected to be able to handle the full load of the site, it eventually became clear that our container-based fleet was struggling to keep up with demand. This resulted in higher latencies and slightly elevated error rates across the Box web application. In order to recover application performance, we put the virtual-machine-based fleet back in service to share the load with the container-based one.\n\nâ\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* The capacity projection model for the container-based fleet has been adjusted to reflect the outcome of this maintenance. This means the more capacity will be available in the container-based fleet as we retire the virtual-machine-based fleet.\n* We are improving our observability to detect early indicators of insufficient capacity, so we can react to them before customer experience is impacted.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.Â \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

During this time, some users may have encountered loading issues while trying to sign a document. The issue occurred as a result of the release of a new feature in Box Sign.

During this time, some users were unable to search for items that were uploaded or changed during the impacted timeframe.

The automation put in place did not drive the optimization at a controlled rate, which caused overutilization of available resources and resulted in end-user impact.

This was the result of an automated optimization process to balance out disk space evenly across the underlying hosts in our messaging infrastructure. The optimization process ran across all the hosts, resulting in increased disk activity that affected our search service. As a result of this issue, our search service temporarily failed to index any file changes made after the onset of the issue. As a result, we stopped the optimization automation, and as a result, we observed incremental recovery until all the messages were processed.

This caused a high internal queue build up as the system backlog built due to CPU resource contention.  As the queue size build up was significant, the recovery took some time. \n\nâ\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* We are working towards reviewing and adding more alerting for improved diagnostics for such issues. \n* We have added a caching layer to reduce the dependency between our backend datasets and customer applications. This should reduce the potential impact to the customer experience if we face a similar issue.\n\nâ\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 10:24am PST and 11:20am PST on February 6th, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, a subset of Boxâs external load balancers became unstable due to extremely high CPU usage, which resulted in intermittent issues for customers trying to access the Box Service. The issue occurred as a result of network socket exhaustion on external load balancers which was caused by a migration of certain traffic to the public cloud. We were able to resolve the issue by rolling back the migration at issue as well as increasing available load balancer capacity. In addition, we are working on updating the required amount of resources and capacity we need in the public cloud for these migrations as well as improving our monitoring to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.Â \n\nâ\n\n**Analysis** \n\nâ\n\nAs Box moves to the public cloud, we have migrated multiple workloads from our on-prem datacenters to the public cloud. The service in question is responsible for an extremely high connection count. While moving this service away from the last on-prem datacenter it occupied, the load balancers in the public cloud became temporarily overwhelmed. This resulted in the exhaustion of available network sockets for the load balancers to use. This drove up CPU usage as a result of connection retries, eventually causing instances to fail healthchecks and be recreated. As instances were being recreated, they would drop traffic and move the high connection count to a different instance, further compounding the issue. We were able to resolve this issue by rolling back the migration, which relieved the connection counts on the load balancers. Furthermore, by adding more capacity we were able to provide the necessary headroom to recover completely. We are working on adding capacity to our cloud load balancing stack and updating our monitoring to immediately point to the root cause if a similar issue is encountered in the future.\n\nâ\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Add additional capacity to the public cloud load balancing stack\n* Update existing monitoring to account for network socket usage and exhaustion\n\nâ\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

In addition, we are working on improving our change management process to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future._Â \n\nâ\n\n_Analysis _\n\n_The issue was a result of a change from HTTP metrics communication in the region to HTTPS metrics communication. This change failed and resulted in a communication failure between our metrics agent and the metric sink it writes to. During the communication failure, the metrics agent will locally cache the data up to a max capacity. In our deployments, we did not have enough resources deployed for this cache. The impact was resource exhaustion in a cluster running our upload and download services resulting in frequent service restarts due to an out-of-memory exception_\n\nâ\n\n_Corrective Actions_\n\n_The following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:_\n\n* _Increased the deployment resources to allow for the additional capacity_ \n* _Added specific alerting for this scenario_ \n\nâ\n\n_We are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nâ\n\nBetween 10:00 AM PST on January 31, 2023, and 4:00 PM PST on February 1, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some enterprise admins may have experienced delays running Box admin reports. The issue occurred due to backend resource exhaustion in our reporting system. We were able to resolve the issue by removing idle reporting resources and adjusting our internal configurations governing recycling of idle reporting resources. In addition, to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, we will be provisioning additional monitoring to detect an excess buildup of idle reporting resources before they impact the customer experience.Â \n\nâ\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe Enterprise Reporting product dynamically creates compute clusters to run reports requested by customers and then destroys them once they are idle in order to free up capacity for new clusters to be launched. The root cause of this issue was that the process responsible for destroying these reporting compute clusters was unable to keep up with the rate at which clusters were scheduled for destruction, creating a backlog that eventually resulted in temporary exhaustion of the compute resource available to run customer reports. As a result, some enterprise admins may have experienced delays in running reports during the impacted timeframe. Additionally, this issue took longer to detect than it otherwise may have because our monitoring initially failed to distinguish the resulting customer report backlog from the expected higher customer reporting traffic that typically occurs at the end of each month.\n\nâ\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Update the reporting cluster destruction process so that it can keep pace with the rate at which clusters are provisioned\n* Add direct monitoring for a backlog of reporting clusters that are scheduled for destruction\n* Add direct monitoring for exhaustion of available reporting compute resources\n\nâ\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

This caused a high internal queue build up as the system backlog built due to CPU resource contention.  As the queue size build up was significant, the recovery took some time. \n\nâ\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* We are working towards reviewing and adding more alerting for improved diagnostics for such issues. \n* We have added a caching layer to reduce the dependency between our backend datasets and customer applications. This should reduce the potential impact to the customer experience if we face a similar issue.\n\nâ\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n Between January 23, 2023 at 11:46 am PST and January 26, 2023 at 3:11 pm PST, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, a newly re-deployed load balancer instance had a faulty network connection that caused it to be unreachable from our internal network. This resulted in timeouts for any traffic processed by this load balancer, and as a result, users may have experienced upload or download operations time out. We were able to resolve the issue by removing the faulty instance from the pool. In addition, we are working on improving our health-checks for newly deployed instances to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n**Analysis** \n\nIn our public cloud infrastructure, we use managed instance groups \\(MIGs\\) to regulate and group load balancers that function as backends for the external load balancer. The issue started when a scheduled re-deploy task created a load balancer instance with an incorrect internal network configuration. Additionally, our existing health checks did not account for validating the instanceâs internal connectivity. As a result, all traffic that was sent to this particular instance timed out, in addition to any telemetry that would have been generated by the instance. The issue was corrected by removing the instance from the group, and we are working on improving our health checking as well as observability to reduce the risk of similar issues occurring again in the future. \n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Importing missing external load balancer metrics to observability platforms for alerting and dashboards\n* Adding additional pre-enable health-checks to new load balancer instances\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can.

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nOn January 23rd from 11:48am PT to 1:07pm PT and on January 24th from 7:49am PT to 8:36am PT and 5:07pm PT to 9:02pm PT, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users experienced higher than normal latency and/or timeouts when trying to access content in Box via one of our applications or our Public API. Specifically, some users of the Metadata Query API experienced elevated latencies and timeouts.\n\nâ\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe issue occurred due to  an overload of a localized area of one of our datastores, resulting in the request queue backing up and causing latency degradation for Downloads, Box Notes, Metadata and other related services for some users. This additional load was induced by an internal data migration our engineering team was performing at that time. One of the changes needed to perform this migration caused an unexpected amplification of requests to a localized area of one of our datastores containing schema information. This change was tested prior to deployment, performed as expected after deployment, but caused impact at peak load.\n\nâ\n\nRequests to this server developed a backlog which affected latency of Box Metadata generally, resulting in elevated latencies and some timeouts for dependent Box services. We were able to resolve the issue by reducing load on this datastore via additional caching, shedding some load and rolling back some recent changes. We are working on process and tooling improvements to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\nâ\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Patched a bug in our data migration code that caused read requests amplification and validated it.\n* Closed a gap in observability, in order to identify similar load increases before they reach a tipping point and cause impact.\n* Increased capacity for this localized area that holds schema information, in order to handle any future surges in traffic more gracefully.\n\nâ\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.Â \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 3:30pm PDT and 4:17pm PDT on Jan 9th, 2023, some users may have experienced difficulties while working on the Box platform. During this time, users may have experienced slow login times as well as failures when attempting to upload and download files. \n\n## **Analysis**\n\nThe issue occurred as an unexpected result of a resource utilization priority conflict during the deployment process of an internal tool. Specifically, an internal service being deployed to our production environment had a higher resource utilization priority than another critical system process, which subsequently failed when affected nodesâ resources were exhausted. We were able to resolve the issue by reverting the change.\n\nIn addition, we are improving our change risk assessment criteria and health alerts for this kind of tool, and working to design a more progressive deployment process for this internal tool to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\n## **Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improving our risk assessment criteria for deploying these types of tools. \n\n* Extending our capacity guidelines to provide more clarity around system resource consumption and better resource distribution.\n* Increasing our alerting to detect early warning signs of systems running at a higher capacity than expected.\n\n \n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.Â \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween 9:44 pm PST on December 4, 2022 and 12:32 am PST on December 5, 2022 and between 4:00 pm PST and 5:53 pm PST on December 5, 2022, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some users may have experienced higher than normal latency and/or timeouts when trying to access content in Box via one of our applications or our Public API. The issue occurred due to a sudden surge in traffic to a localized area of our metadata cluster, resulting in increased request queue latencies and degradation of Downloads, Box Notes, Metadata and other related services. The issue was resolved after the traffic to the servers hosting the data was decreased. We have since then made observability improvements to identify similar traffic surges faster and are working on process and tooling improvements to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\nâ\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThis issue occurred due to a sudden surge in traffic to a localized area of our metadata cluster. Although Box is designed to be capable of handling short surges in traffic, this issue was caused by a sustained increase in traffic directed to a single server. As a result, requests to this server developed a backlog, which affected latency of Box Metadata generally; this resulted in users experiencing degradation of uploads, downloads, Box Notes, and other related services. The issue was resolved after the traffic to server hosting the data was decreased.  We are working on improvements to how data is sharded and cached and also process and tooling improvements to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.\n\nâ\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Added observability improvements to identify similar traffic surges more rapidly\n* Added additional caching to proactively limit localized surges in traffic to individual servers\n* Added the ability to quickly react and throttle surges in traffic to individual servers\n* Improving resilience of Box services to high latencies when accessing data stores to minimize the impact of any similar issues in the future\n\nâ\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.\n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",

          "body": "We recently addressed issues affecting Shield and Classification. We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 5:16 PM PDT and 7:40 PM PDT on November 23, 2022, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, it was not possible to access Shield Admin pages, the Shield Admin dashboard and the Classification Label admin pages. Additionally, some users may have experienced issues manually classifying files and folders. The issue occurred as a result of an inadequate capacity configuration that prevented a service from starting gracefully after rebooting. We were able to resolve the issue by increasing the capacity of the affected service. In addition, we are working to extend our capacity guidelines and to improve our alerting capabilities to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.Â \n\nâ\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThe service affected by this incident recently experienced a significant increase in traffic as a result of the release of a new feature. Although the service remained stable after the featureâs release, the temporary degradation of another supporting service resulted in an increased number of retries, which in turn resulted in increased processing activity. As a result of this increased CPU usage, the impacted service eventually rebooted, but was unable to effectively reboot because the memory currently allocated for that service was inadequate during this window of increased processing activity. We were able to resolve the issue by increasing the capacity of the affected service.\n\nâ\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Extending our capacity guidelines to provide more clarity around system restart considerations.\n* Increasing our alerting to detect early warning signs of systems running at a higher capacity than expected.\n* Improving the documentation of our existing alerts to allow us to respond more quickly to system reboot issues.\n\nâ\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.Â \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain this issue and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\nBetween November 1, 2022 at 4:40 PM PDT and November 2, 2022 at 8:08 PM PDT, users in your enterprise may have experienced difficulties while working in Box.  This issue occurred as a result of missing a critical step in a regular database maintenance procedure, which resulted in missing indices on the file table. As a result, the File Requests service experienced some latency. Additionally, Workflow Tasks users experienced an outage that manifested as UI errors. The issue was remediated by adding back indices to the file table. Because this remediation was time consuming, some users in your enterprise may have experienced degraded performance until November 2, 2022 at 8:08 PM PDT.\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Adding validations to ensure no steps are missing during maintenance procedures;\n* Creating additional alerting to identify similar issues ahead of time;\n* Improving our rollback plan to facilitate reversion of similar changes to minimize remediation time;\n* Adjusting our procedure to improve testing of changes on a node before deploying the change to production;\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Box Team",

We would like to take the opportunity to further explain these issues and the steps we have taken to keep them from happening in the future.\n\n \n\nBetween 6:55 pm PDT and 7:07 pm PDT on October 16, 2022, some users may have experienced difficulties while working in Box. During this time, some Box users may have experienced issues with uploads, downloads, notes and public API. The issue occurred as a result of a latent issue with platform workload initialization controllers failing to detect new workloads. \n\nâ\n\n**Analysis** \n\nThis issue was the result of a controller component that provides service-to-service authentication failing to detect that new workloads needed to be processed. This controller monitors an internal API for new workloads that match certain criteria indicating that the workloads are initializing and waiting for internal credentials. In this case, the impacted controller failed to detect new workloads waiting in the API results that should have been processed. We were able to resolve the issue by restarting the controllers and the new workloads were processed. In addition, we also added alerts to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.Â The existing alerting in place was monitoring the controllers for errors, but because the controllers were idle, no alerts were immediately raised. \n\nâ\n\n**Corrective Actions**\n\nThe following corrective actions have been completed or are planned:\n\n* Improve alerting on the workloads if they time out while waiting for the controller to process them.\n* Replace the controller with a more robust method of authenticating workloads.\n\nâ\n\nWe are continuously working to improve Box and want to make sure we are delivering the best product and user experience we can. We hope we have provided some clarity here and we would be happy to answer any questions you may still have regarding this matter.Â \n\nSincerely,  \nThe Box Team",
