After investigating this issue further, the resulting error when links failed would include \"invalid unsubscribe request\" on an otherwise properly formatted unsubscribe link. Due to the nature of the issue, not all unsubscribe links during the affected period failed but instead the occurring issue intermittently affected links. On October 26th at approximately 9:30 AM PDT, the engineering team deployed code to resolve the intermittently failing unsubscribe links. Valid unsubscribe links previously failing have since been reported as resolving properly. This issue did not affect mail send. Systems are now operating normally at this time.

Users may experience timeouts and server errors when connecting the SendGrid API or using the user interface via app.sendgrid.com. This includes errors when trying to access the SendGrid login page as well as API responses including 5XX type errors and \"internal server error\" with valid request information. This did impact mail send for both web API and SMTP, but a deploy was made at 2:45 PM PT to fix the delays in mail sending.  Problems with the user interface as well as other non-mail send API connectivity is still being investigated. We will provide another update in an hour or as soon as more information becomes available.",
