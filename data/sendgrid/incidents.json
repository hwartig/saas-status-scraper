After investigating this issue further, the resulting error when links failed would include \"invalid unsubscribe request\" on an otherwise properly formatted unsubscribe link. Due to the nature of the issue, not all unsubscribe links during the affected period failed but instead the occurring issue intermittently affected links. On October 26th at approximately 9:30 AM PDT, the engineering team deployed code to resolve the intermittently failing unsubscribe links. Valid unsubscribe links previously failing have since been reported as resolving properly. This issue did not affect mail send. Systems are now operating normally at this time.

This issue affected mail send as well as user interface web console functionality for the SendGrid platform. This only affected users which connected through the United States East Coast region to api.sendgrid.com. It was determined that one of the connectivity points within the region for api.sendgrid.com was unable to accept API traffic which was causing the API connections to fail. This connectivity point was fixed at 12:54 PM PT, and this change allowed new connections to successfully use api.sendgrid.com from the region.
