This only affected users which connected through the United States East Coast region to api.sendgrid.com. It was determined that one of the connectivity points within the region for api.sendgrid.com was unable to accept API traffic which was causing the API connections to fail. This connectivity point was fixed at 12:54 PM PT, and this change allowed new connections to successfully use api.sendgrid.com from the region.

Our team determined that this issue began at 10:13 AM PT and lasted through 1:29 PM PT, at which point a deploy was made to fix the problem. During the affected period, the SendGrid system began producing failures for attempts made to the Email Validations API endpoint for SendGrid. Users accessing this feature would have seen \"403 FORBIDDEN\" API response errors despite having proper permissions and feature access to this API endpoint. This did not impact mail send.
