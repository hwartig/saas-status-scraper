Users accessing Mailbox Provider Stats, Email Clients & Devices Stats, Browser Stats, Geographical Stats, and Monthly/Weekly Category Stats are delayed up to 48 hours before being posted to the SendGrid system.  Global Stats and Daily Category Stats are not affected.\n\nThese stats delays do not impact mail send.  Stats posting delays will vary between users.\n\nOur engineering team made a deploy to rectify delays in the affected statistics.  These deployed changes are anticipated to stabilize the SendGrid stats posting system but will require time to finalize.   Statistics may continue to have delays until this incident is resolved.\n\nAnother update will be provided within the next 24 hours or as soon as more information is available.",
