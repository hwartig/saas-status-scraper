After investigating this issue further, the resulting error when links failed would include \"invalid unsubscribe request\" on an otherwise properly formatted unsubscribe link. Due to the nature of the issue, not all unsubscribe links during the affected period failed but instead the occurring issue intermittently affected links. On October 26th at approximately 9:30 AM PDT, the engineering team deployed code to resolve the intermittently failing unsubscribe links. Valid unsubscribe links previously failing have since been reported as resolving properly. This issue did not affect mail send. Systems are now operating normally at this time.
