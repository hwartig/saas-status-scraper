Accelerate keeps a pool of warm instances to serve these requests quickly and when that warm pool is depleted we fallback on creating cold instances.\n\nWe identified a bug in the cold instance path which prevented us from bringing Accelerate online for all users fast enough. While some users were able to get instances from the warm path as new instances were added to the pool, it wasn't fast enough to serve the backlog of users who were requesting new instances. Once we found and patched the bug Accelerate was able to serve all instance requests within minutes.\n\nBecause this only affected the creation of new instances, users with instances already running would have not experienced any issues.\n\nThank you for your patience. We're already working on collecting data and insights for our postmortem which always aim to make our products and services better.",
