If you are not seeing traces in Apollo Studio and have traces enabled for a percentage of requests, we recommend restarting any such servers to regain trace-reporting functionality. Reporting aggregate statistics is unaffected.\n\n---\n\nUpon the most recent update, metric ingestion has returned to a stable state and new metrics are being processed. \n\nOverall, the result of this incident is that between 9:30am to 1pm Pacific, metrics were unable to be collected and have been permanently lost. Users will see a gap of data for this time in graphs within Studio as well as any other integrated analytics tools (e.g. Datadog). Further, some users may have experienced issues in buffering pending metrics reports during this outage, depending on their configuration. \n\nThe root cause of this outage has been identified as a large scale event, along with several additional factors which caused such a long delay in our ability to restore service. We have collected initial notes during this incident that already point to improvements we can make on our side, and we will be conducting a thorough postmortem to ensure that such an incident does not occur again.
