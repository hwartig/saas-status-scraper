The change was to migrate our internal loadbalancers to best practice Edge optimized routing.\n\nIn doing so, we removed a route used by default Routers, thus making their fallback to AWS fail with a 4XX.\n\nFrom our observations of our systems, this impacted some of our traffic but with our knowledge of our rates of success/failure with our GCP Uplink, we do not believe any Routers running in our customer's systems were critically impacted.\n\nNo Apollo Gateways were impacted by this change at all.\n\nOn March 23rd, at around 2:30 PM Pacific, we patched this issue and confirmed seeing our 4XX error rate drop back to almost 0%.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this caused by this escaped bug, and will be working in the coming days on our postmortem. As always, we appreciate your patience!",
