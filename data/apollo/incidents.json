The change was to migrate our internal loadbalancers to best practice Edge optimized routing.\n\nIn doing so, we removed a route used by default Routers, thus making their fallback to AWS fail with a 4XX.\n\nFrom our observations of our systems, this impacted some of our traffic but with our knowledge of our rates of success/failure with our GCP Uplink, we do not believe any Routers running in our customer's systems were critically impacted.\n\nNo Apollo Gateways were impacted by this change at all.\n\nOn March 23rd, at around 2:30 PM Pacific, we patched this issue and confirmed seeing our 4XX error rate drop back to almost 0%.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this caused by this escaped bug, and will be working in the coming days on our postmortem.

          "body": "UPDATE (11/3/2022): Due to the way in which traces and stats are processed, it's possible that servers which were reporting usage to Apollo during this incident are in a state where reporting raw traces to Apollo Studio is disabled. If you are not seeing traces in Apollo Studio and have traces enabled for a percentage of requests, we recommend restarting any such servers to regain trace-reporting functionality. Reporting aggregate statistics is unaffected.\n\n---\n\nUpon the most recent update, metric ingestion has returned to a stable state and new metrics are being processed. \n\nOverall, the result of this incident is that between 9:30am to 1pm Pacific, metrics were unable to be collected and have been permanently lost. Users will see a gap of data for this time in graphs within Studio as well as any other integrated analytics tools (e.g. Datadog). Further, some users may have experienced issues in buffering pending metrics reports during this outage, depending on their configuration. \n\nThe root cause of this outage has been identified as a large scale event, along with several additional factors which caused such a long delay in our ability to restore service. We have collected initial notes during this incident that already point to improvements we can make on our side, and we will be conducting a thorough postmortem to ensure that such an incident does not occur again. Thank you to everyone for your patience and support. We are committed to meeting high standards of reliability and excellence and using the learnings from this incident to improve.",
