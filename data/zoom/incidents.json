We sincerely apologize for the incident and the impact on our customers. We take this very seriously, and our goal is to do everything possible to make sure this type of incident cannot happen again.\n\nIncluded is the summary, root cause, solution, and the prevention plan.\n\nService Issue:\nReported: April 16, 2025 11:25 AM PDT\nResolved: April 16, 2025 1:12 PM PDT\n\nSummary:\nCustomers could not access Zoom services in the US and International regions due to the unavailability of the zoom.us domain.\n\nRoot Cause:\nOn April 16, 2025, Zoom started to investigate the zoom.us domain resolution failures. Upon investigation, Zoom's domain name servers were properly replying to requests. However, upon further investigation with our registrar Markmonitor and GoDaddy Registry, the domain zoom.us was unavailable due to a server block by GoDaddy Registry. This block was the result of a communication error between Zoom’s domain registrar, Markmonitor, and GoDaddy Registry, which resulted in GoDaddy Registry mistakenly shutting down the zoom.us domain. There was no product, security, network failure, or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack at Zoom during the outage.\n\nEnd users who had already joined Zoom meetings or Zoom phone calls were not impacted. Any start, join, or schedule meetings actions were unable to be completed successfully since the requests required a DNS lookup, which could not be completed.\n\nSolution:\nZoom, Markmonitor, and GoDaddy worked to identify and remove the server block, which restored service to the zoom.us domain. Due to the DNS entries themselves being cached at multiple levels and having a time-to-live (TTL) set, it took a few additional minutes to propagate across all Internet infrastructure after the zoom.us domain reactivation.\n\nPrevention:\nZoom worked with GoDaddy Registry and Markmonitor to implement additional technical changes and processes to help ensure that this issue does not reoccur. As a part of that change, GoDaddy Registry and Markmonitor have already put in place a registry lock that restricts server block commands from being placed on the zoom.us domain.",
