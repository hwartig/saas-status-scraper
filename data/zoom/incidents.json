These issues do not affect Zoom Rooms for Windows or Mac 5.17.0 and greater; upgrading to the latest version will resolve the problem.  As a workaround on versions 5.16.x and lower, users can join Microsoft Teams meetings by pressing the \"Microsoft Teams\" button on the Zoom Rooms Controller Home Screen (if enabled) or pressing the \"Join\" button and selecting Microsoft Teams, then manually entering the Microsoft Teams meeting ID and passcode.
