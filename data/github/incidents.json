Customers may have seen extended wait times for migrations to start or complete.<br /><br />This incident was initially observed as a slowdown in migration processing. During our investigation, we identified that a recent change aimed at improving API query performance caused an increase in load signals, which triggered migration throttling. As a result, the performance of migrations was negatively impacted, and overall migration duration increased. In parallel, we identified a race condition that caused a specific migration to be repeatedly re-queued, further straining system resources and contributing to a backlog of migration jobs, resulting in accumulated delays. No data was lost, and all migrations were ultimately processed successfully.<br /><br />We have reverted the feature flag associated with a query change and are working to improve system safeguards to help prevent similar race condition issues from occurring in the future.",

On average, the error rate was 1.4% with a peak error rate of 2.24%. This was due to a configuration change which unexpectedly led a critical service to shut down on a subset of hosts that store repository data.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by re-deploying the affected service to restore its functionality.<br /><br />In order to prevent similar incidents from happening again, we identified the cause that triggered this behavior and mitigated it for future deployments.

At the time, 837 migrations across 57 organizations were affected. Impacted migrations would have shown the error message \"Git source migration failed. Error message: An error occurred. Please contact support for further assistance.\" in the migration logs and required a retry.<br /><br />The root cause of the issue was a recent configuration change that caused our workers, responsible for syncing the Git repository, to lose the necessary access required for the migration. We were able to retrieve the needed access for the workers , and all dependent services resumed normal operation.<br />Weâ€™ve identified and implemented additional safeguards to help prevent similar disruptions in the future.<br />",

The resulting error rates, which ranged from 2â€“5% of total requests, led to intermittent service disruption for users. The issue was triggered by heavy workloads on the database leading to connection saturation.\n\nThe incident mitigated when the database throttling activated which allowed the system to rebalance the connections. This restored the traffic flow to the database and restored service functionality.\n\nTo prevent similar issues in the future, we are reviewing the capacity of the database, improving monitoring and alerting systems, and implementing safeguards to reduce time to detection and mitigation.",

At peak, approximately 1â€“1.5% of users were affected by delays in synchronizing pull requests. During this period, users may have seen a \"Processing updates\" message in their pull requests after pushing new commits, and the new commits did not appear in the Pull Request view as expected. The Pull Request synchronization process has automatic retries and most delays were automatically resolved. Any Pull Requests that were not resynchronized during this window were manually synchronized on Friday, April 11 at 14:23 UTC.<br /><br />This was due to a misconfigured GeoIP lookup file that our routine GitHub operations depended on and led to background job processing to fail. <br /><br />We mitigated the incident by reverting to a known good version of the GeoIP lookup file on affected hosts.<br /><br /><br />We are working to enhance our CI testing and automation by validating GeoIP metadata to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.",

This resulted in an increase in queue depth due to retries on failures to perform those jobs causing delays for non-migration sourced jobs.<br /><br />We declared an incident once we confirmed that this issue was not isolated to the problematic migration and other repositories were also failing to process ref updates. <br /><br />We mitigated the issue by stopping the migration and short circuiting the remaining jobs. Additionally, we increased the worker pool of this job to reduce the time required to recover. <br /><br />As a result of this incident, we are revisiting our repository migration process and are working to isolate potentially problematic migration workloads from non-migration workloads. <br />",

During the incident, about 0.3% of all workflow runs queued during the time failed to start, about 0.67% of all workflow runs were delayed by an average of 10 minutes, and about 0.16% of all workflow runs ultimately ended with an infrastructure failure. This was due to a networking issue with an underlying service provider. At 00:15 UTC the service provider mitigated their issue, and service was restored immediately for Actions.

During the incident, about 0.6% of workflow runs failed to start, 0.8% of workflow runs were delayed by an average of one hour, and 0.1% of runs ultimately ended with an infrastructure failure. The issue stemmed from connectivity problems between the Actions services and certain nodes within one of our Redis clusters. The service began recovering once connectivity to the Redis cluster was restored at 13:41 UTC. These connectivity issues are typically not a concern because we can fail over to healthier replicas. However, due to an unrelated issue, there was a replication delay at the time of the incident, and failing over would have caused a greater impact on our customers. We are working on improving our resiliency and automation processes for this infrastructure to improve the speed of diagnosing and resolving similar issues in the future.",

Searches for PRs, Issues, Actions workflow runs, Packages, Releases, and other products were impacted, resulting in failed requests or stale data. The connectivity issue self-resolved after 90 minutes. The backlog of indexing jobs was fully processed and saw recovery soon after, and queries to all indexes also saw an immediate return to normal throughput.<br /><br />We are working with our cloud provider to identify the root cause and are researching additional layers of redundancy to reduce customer impact in the future for issues like this one. We are also exploring mitigation strategies for faster resolution.",

This led to degraded performance, manifesting as increased latency for write operations and elevated request timeout rates across multiple services.<br /><br />The incident was mitigated by halting execution of the problematic background job and disabling the feature flag controlling the job execution.

On average, 5% of Actions workflow runs were delayed by 31 minutes. The delays were caused by updates in a dependent service that led to failures in Redis connectivity in one region. We mitigated the incident by failing over the impacted service and re-routing the serviceâ€™s traffic out of that region. We are working to improve monitoring and processes of failover to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.",

During this period, the billing usage and budget pages were also inaccessible. Initially, we reported that GitHub Actions was affected, but we later determined that the impact was limited to jobs interacting with Packages services, while jobs that did not upload or download Packages remained unaffected.<br /><br />The incident occurred due to an error in newly introduced code, which caused containers to get into a bad state, ultimately leading to billing API calls failing with 503 errors. We mitigated the issue by rolling back the contributing change. In response to this incident, we are enhancing error handling, improving the resiliency of our billing API calls to minimize customer impact, and improving change rollout practices to catch these potential issues prior to deployment.",

At the peak of the incident the delay resulted in ~10% of all notifications taking over 10 minutes to be delivered, with the remaining ~90% being delivered within 5-10 minutes. This was due to insufficient capacity in worker pools as a result of increased load during peak hours.<br /><br />We also encountered delivery delays for a small number of webhooks, with delays of up-to 2.5 minutes to be delivered.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by scaling out the service to meet the demand.<br /><br />The increase in capacity gives us extra headroom, and we are working to improve our capacity planning to prevent issues like this occurring in the future.",
