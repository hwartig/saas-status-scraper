On average, the error rate was 46% and peaked at 96% of requests to the service. XL and Intel runners recovered by 10:10 UTC, with the other types taking longer to recover.<br /><br />The degraded capacity was triggered by a scheduled event at 07:00 UTC that led to a permission failure on Mac runner hosts, blocking reimage operations.  The permission issue was resolved by 9:41 UTC, but the recovery of available runners took longer than expected due to a combination of backoff logic slowing backend operations and some hosts needing state resets.<br /><br />We deployed changes immediately following the incident to address the scheduled event and ensure that similar failures will not block critical operations in the future. We are also working to reduce the end-to-end time for self-healing of offline hosts for quicker full recovery of future capacity or host events.",

The issue was caused by a faulty configuration change that disrupted service to service communication in GitHub Actions. During this period, in-progress jobs were delayed and new jobs would not start due to a failure to acquire runners, and about 30% of all jobs failed. GitHub Pages users were unable to build or deploy their Pages during this period.<br /><br />The offending change was rolled back within 15 minutes of its deployment, after which Actions workflows and Pages deployments began to succeed. Actions customers continued to experience delays for about 15 minutes after the rollback was completed while services worked through the backlog of queued jobs.

Codespace creations and resumes were failed over to another region at 15:01 UTC. While many of the impacted instances self-recovered after mitigation efforts, approximately 2,000 codespaces remained stuck in a \"shutting down\" state while the team evaluated possible methods to recover unpushed data from the latest active session of affected codespaces. Unfortunately, recovery of that data was not possible. We unblocked shutdown of those codespaces, with all instances either shut down or available by 8:26 UTC on September 19.<br /><br />The disconnects were triggered by an exhaustion of resources in the network relay infrastructure in that region, but the lack of self-recovery was caused by an unhandled error impacting the local agent, which led to an unclean shutdown.<br /><br />We are improving the resilience of the local agent to disconnect events to ensure shutdown of codespaces is always clean without data loss.  We have also addressed the exhausted resources in the network relay and will be investing in improved detection and resilience to reduce the impact of similar events in the future.",

We are performing a full reconciliation of the search index and customers can expect to see records being updated and content becoming searchable for all repos again between now and Sept 25.<br /><br />NOTE: Users who notice missing or outdated repositories in search results can force reindexing by starring or un-starring the repository. Other repository actions such as adding topics, or updating the repository description, will also result in reindexing. In general, changes to searchable artifacts in GitHub will also update their respective search index in near-real time.<br /><br />User impact has been mitigated with the exception of the 1.5% of repos that are missing from the search index. The change responsible for the search issue has been reverted, and full reconciliation of the search index is underway, expected to complete by September 23. We have added additional checks to our indexing model to ensure this failure does not happen again. We are also investigating faster repair alternatives.<br /><br />To avoid resource contention and possible further issues we are currently not repairing repositories or organizations individually at this time. No repository data was lost, and other search types were not affected.",

This was due a partial deployment of a feature flag to a global rate limiter. The flag triggered behavior that unintentionally rate limited all requests, resulting in 100% of them returning 403 errors. The issue was resolved by reverting the feature flag which resulted in immediate recovery.<br /><br />The root cause of the incident was from an undetected edge case in our rate limiting logic. The flag was meant to scale down rate limiting for a subset of users, but unintentionally put our rate limiting configuration into an invalid state.<br /><br />To prevent this from happening again, we have addressed the bug with our rate limiting. We are also adding additional monitors to detect anomalies in our traffic patterns, which will allow us to identify similar issues during future deployments. Furthermore, we are exploring ways to test our rate limit scaling in our internal environment to enhance our pre-production validation process.<br />",

During this time, avatar images appeared broken on github.com for affected users. On average, this impacted about 82% of users routed through one of our Middle East-based points-of-presence, which represents about 0.14% of global users.<br /><br />This was due to a configuration change within GitHub's edge infrastructure in the affected region, causing HTTP requests to fail. As a result, image requests returned HTTP 503 errors. The failure to detect the issues was the result of an alerting threshold set too low.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by removing the affected site from service, which restored avatar serving for impacted users.<br /><br />To prevent this from recurring, we have tuned configuration defaults for graceful degradation. We also added new health checks to automatically shift traffic from impacted sites. We are updating our monitoring to prevent undetected errors like this in the future.",

Copilot saw an average of 36% of requests fail with a peak failure rate of 77%. Approximately 2% of all non-Copilot Web and REST API traffic requests failed.\n\nThis incident occurred after we initiated a production database migration to drop a column from a table backing copilot functionality. While the column was no longer in direct use, our ORM continued to reference the dropped column. This led to a large number of 5xx responses and was similar to the incident on August 5th. At 21:15 UTC, we applied a fix to the production schema and by 21:17 UTC, all services had fully recovered.\n\nWhile repairs were in progress to avoid this situation, they were not completed quickly enough to prevent a second incident. We have now implemented a temporary block for all drop column operations as an immediate solution while we add more safeguards to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. We are also implementing graceful degradation so that Copilot issues will not impact other features of our product.",

          "body": "On August 21, 2025, from approximately 15:37 UTC to 18:10 UTC, customers experienced increased delays and failures when starting jobs on GitHub Actions using standard hosted runners. This was caused by connectivity issues in our East US region, which prevented runners from retrieving jobs and sending progress updates. As a result, capacity was significantly reduced, especially for busier configurations, leading to queuing and service interruptions. Approximately 8.05% of jobs on public standard Ubuntu24 runners and 3.4% of jobs on private standard Ubuntu24 runners did not start as expected.<br /><br />By 18:10 UTC, we had mitigated the issue by provisioning additional resources in the affected region and burning down the backlog of queued runner assignments. By the end of that day, we deployed changes to improve runner connectivity resilience and graceful degradation in similar situations.  We are also taking further steps to improve system resiliency by enhancing observability of network connection health with runners and improving load distribution and failover handling to help prevent similar issues in the future.",

When searching for pull requests, issues, and workflow runs, users would have seen some slow, empty or incomplete results. In some cases, pull requests failed to load.<br /><br />The incident was triggered by intermittent connectivity issues between our load balancers and search hosts. While retry logic initially masked these problems, retry queues eventually overwhelmed the load balancers, causing failure. The incident was mitigated at 14:33 UTC by throttling our search index pipeline. <br /><br />Our automated alerting and internal retries reduced the impact of this event significantly. As a result of this incident we believe we have identified a faster way to mitigate it in the future. We are also working on multiple solutions to resolve the underlying connectivity issues.<br />",

Users experienced inaccurate or incomplete results, failures to load certain pages (like Issues, Pull Requests, Projects, and Deployments), and broken components like Actions workflow and label filters.<br /><br />Most user impact occurred between 14:00 UTC and 15:30 UTC, when up to 75% of search queries failed, and updates to search results were delayed by up to 100 minutes. <br /><br />The incident was triggered by intermittent connectivity issues between our load balancers and search hosts. While retry logic initially masked these problems, retry queues eventually overwhelmed the load balancers, causing failure. The query failures were mitigated at 15:30 UTC after throttling our search indexing pipeline to reduce load and stabilize retries.  The connectivity failures were resolved at 17:14 UTC after the automated reboot of a search host, causing the rest of the system to recover.  <br /><br />We have improved internal monitors and playbooks, and tuned our search cluster load balancer to further mitigate the recurrence of this failure mode.

During this time, a configuration change to improve our UI deployment system caused a surge in requests to a backend datastore. This change led to an unexpected spike in connection attempts to our datastore and saturated its connection backlog and resulted in intermittent failures to serve required UI content. This resulted in elevated error rates for frontend requests.<br /><br />The incident was mitigated by reverting the configuration, which restored normal service.<br /><br />Following mitigation, we are evaluating improvements to our alerting thresholds and exploring architectural changes to reduce load to this datastore and improve the resilience of our UI delivery pipeline.",

On average, the error rate was .005%, with a peak error rate of 3.89%. This was due to a sustained increase in unauthenticated repository traffic.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by applying regional rate limiting, rolling back a service that was unable to scale with the additional traffic, and addressed a bug that impacted the caching of raw requests. Additionally, we horizontally scaled several dependencies of the service to appropriately handle the increase in traffic.<br /><br />We are working on improving our time to detection and have implemented controls to prevent similar incidents in future.",

On average, the error rate was .005%, with a peak error rate of 3.89%. This was due to a sustained increase in unauthenticated repository traffic.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by applying regional rate limiting, rolling back a service that was unable to scale with the additional traffic, and addressed a bug that impacted the caching of raw requests. Additionally, we horizontally scaled several dependencies of the service to appropriately handle the increase in traffic.<br /><br />We are working on improving our time to detection and have implemented controls to prevent similar incidents in future.",

This was due to resource provisioning failures in one of our datacenter regions. During this period, approximately 2% of Ubuntu-24 hosted runner jobs on private repos were delayed. Other hosted runners, self-hosted runners, and public repo workflows were unaffected.<br /><br />To mitigate the issue, additional worker capacity was added from a different datacenter region at 15:35 UTC and further increased at 16:00 UTC. By 16:30 UTC, job queues were healthy and service was operating normally. Since the incident, we have deployed changes to improve how regional health is accounted for when allocating new runners, and we are investigating further improvements to our automated capacity scaling logic and manual overrides to prevent a recurrence.",

At the peak of this incident (a 2 minute period around 07:00 UTC) error rates peaked at 11% and went down shortly after. Average web request load times rose to 1 second during this same time frame. After this period, traffic gradually recovered but error rate and latency remained slightly elevated until the end of the incident.<br /><br />This incident was triggered by a kernel bug that caused a crash of some of our load balancers during a scheduled process after a kernel upgrade. In order to mitigate the incident, we halted the roll out of our upgrades, and rolled back the impacted instances. We are working to make sure the kernel version is fully removed from our fleet. As a precaution, we temporarily paused the scheduled process to prevent any unintended use in the affected kernel. We also tuned our alerting so we can more quickly detect and mitigate future instances where we experience a sudden drop in load-balancing capacity.",

Impact was more apparent to customers that didn’t have pre-scaled runner pools or who infrequently queued jobs during the incident window.
