          "body": "On July 5, 2024, between 16:31 UTC and 18:08 UTC, the Webhooks service was degraded, with customer impact of delays to all webhook delivery. On average, delivery delays were 24 minutes, with a maximum of 71 minutes. This was caused by a configuration change to the Webhooks service, which led to unauthenticated requests sent to the background job cluster. The configuration error was repaired and re-deploying the service solved the issue. However, this created a thundering herd effect which overloaded the background job queue cluster which put its API layer at max capacity, resulting in timeouts for other job clients, which presented as increased latency for API calls.<br /><br />Shortly after resolving the authentication misconfiguration, we had a separate issue in the background job processing service where health probes were failing, leading to reduced capacity in the background job API layer which magnified the effects of the thundering herd. From 18:21 UTC to 21:14 UTC, Actions runs on PRs experienced approximately 2 minutes delay and maximum of 12 minutes delay. A deployment of the background job processing service remediated the issue.<br /><br />To reduce our time to detection, we have streamlined our dashboards and added alerting for this specific runtime behavior. Additionally, we are working to reduce the blast radius of background job incidents through better workload isolation.<br />",

          "body": "On June 28th, 2024, at 16:06 UTC, a backend update by GitHub triggered a significant number of long-running Organization membership update jobs in our job processing system. The job queue depth rose as these update jobs consumed most of our job worker capacity. This resulted in delays for other jobs across services such as Pull Requests and PR-related Actions workflows. We mitigated the impact to Pull Requests and Actions at 19:32 UTC by pausing all Organization membership update jobs. We deployed a code change at 22:30 UTC to skip over the jobs queued by the backend change and re-enabled Organization membership update jobs. We restored the Organization membership update functionality at 22:52 UTC, including all membership changes queued during the incident.<br /><br />During the incident, about 15% of Action workflow runs experienced a delay of more than five minutes. In addition, Pull Requests had delays in determining merge eligibility and starting associated Action workflows for the duration of the incident. Organization membership updates saw delays for upwards of five hours.<br /><br />To prevent a similar event in the future from impacting our users, we are working to: improve our job management system to better manage our job worker capacity; add more precise monitoring for job delays; and strengthen our testing practices to prevent future recurrences.",

These events indicate when an issue was added to or removed from a project and when their status changed within a project. The data couldn’t be loaded due to a misconfiguration of the service backing these events. This happened after a scheduled secret rotation when the wrongly configured service continued using the old secrets which had expired. <br /><br />We mitigated the incident by remediating the service configuration and have started simplifying the configuration to avoid similar misconfigurations in the future.",

Make a free DockerHub account at https://hub.docker.com (or use an existing account if you have one).<br />2. Create a DockerHub secret/PAT from https://hub.docker.com/settings/security (Read permission should be sufficient).<br />3. Go to https://github.com/settings/codespaces<br /><br />Add three Codespace secrets:<br /><br />- DOCKERHUB_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD (equal to the DockerHub PAT you created)<br />- DOCKERHUB_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_SERVER (equal to https://index.docker.io/v1/)<br />- DOCKERHUB_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_USER (equal to your DockerHub username)<br /><br />4. Make sure these secrets are set as visible to the target repo.<br />5. Create/rebuild your Codespace<br /><br />Steps above are distilled from the official docs: https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/reference/allowing-your-codespace-to-access-a-private-registry#example-secrets",

The new error reporting that was implemented began raising on existing non-user facing errors that are handled further in the flow, at the controller level, which do not cause user impact. We are working to improve our reporting roll out process to reduce issues like this in the future which includes updating monitors and dashboards to exclude this class of error.

GitHub Actions was degraded with 20 - 60 minute delays for workflow run updates. GitHub Enterprise Importer customers experienced longer migration run times due to GitHub Actions delays. Additionally, billing related metrics for budget notifications and UI reporting were delayed leading to outdated billing details. No data was lost and systems caught up after the incident. <br /><br />At 12:31 UTC, we detected increased latency to cloud hosts. At 14:09 UTC, non-critical traffic was paused, which did not result in restoration of service. At 14:27 UTC, we identified high CPU load within a network gateway cluster caused by a scheduled operating system upgrade that resulted in unintended, uneven distribution of traffic within the cluster. We initiated deployment of additional hosts at 16:35 UTC. Rebalancing completed by 17:58 UTC with system recovery observed at 18:03 UTC and completion at 19:06 UTC.<br /><br />We have identified gaps in our monitoring and alerting for load thresholds.

This issue was due to degradation in our background job service affecting 22.4% of total jobs.  Across all affected services, the average job delay was 2m 22s.  Actions jobs themselves were unaffected, this issue affected the timeliness of UI updates, with an average delay of 11m 40s and a maximum of 20m 14s.<br /><br />This incident was due to a performance problem on a single processing node, where Actions UI updates were being processed.  Additionally, a misconfigured monitor did not alert immediately, resulting in a 25m late detection time and a 37m total increase in time to mitigate.   <br /><br />We mitigated the incident by removing the problem node from the cluster and service was restored.  No data was lost, and all jobs executed successfully.<br /><br />To reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future, we have repaired our misconfigured monitor and added additional monitoring to this service. <br />",

          "body": "On May 14, 2024 between 18:00 UTC and 20:10 UTC, GitHub Actions performance was degraded and larger hosted runners using <code>linux-x64</code> images (Ubuntu20, Ubuntu22, Ubuntu24-beta) experienced longer than normal job start up times. Approximately 25% of all runs targeting larger hosted runners queued during this time were slow to start, with a median wait time of 1 minute, 55 seconds.<br /><br />The issue was caused by a downstream dependency overloading, which impacted our machine setup process. Each larger hosted runner job is run on a fresh VM, and one of the setup steps is installing the Actions agent. Up to the point of this incident, we would pull the latest agent version from the GitHub release and install it on the VM. However, during this incident the speciific GitHub release for the Linux x64 Actions agent became overloaded, and our agent downloads were severely throttled. This throttling led to timeouts during the download, and caused our hosted runner system to conclude the VMs were failing to start. We need the Actions agent online to start serving jobs, and with the download timing out, our service assumed the runner wasn't starting up successfully. This failure to start up led to those VMs being reset again and again instead of serving jobs. We mitigated the issue by falling back to a cached version of the Actions agent present on our image.<br /><br />We have further refined the fallback system to automatically use the cached agent binaries, and added new functionality to allow for easier agent downloading from other locations. Both of these measures should eliminate future impacts from similar downstream impact.",

The root cause was identified to be a bug in the logic for checking the state of a configuration which would only manifest under very specific conditions and cause exceptions. These exceptions impacted the backend process for handling workflow run status updates and caused jobs with any annotations to not get updated properly. Jobs without any annotations were not affected. The affected jobs during the incident will get marked as failed after 24 hours, and affected customers will need to manually retry the jobs they want to execute.<br /><br />We resolved the incident by reverting the problematic change.

The problem was identified, and a status update was provided shortly after. A mitigation strategy was implemented by 14:30 UTC, which mitigated the impact.<br /><br />The root cause of the incident was a combination of issues in the request handling process. Specifically, some requests were malformed, which resulted in being incorrectly routed to the wrong deployment. That deployment wasn’t resilient to the malformed requests and resulted in errors.<br /><br />To mitigate the immediate impact, requests were routed away from the failing deployment. This temporarily reduced the number of errors while the underlying issue was investigated and resolved.<br /><br />To prevent similar incidents in the future, we have enhanced validation checks for incoming requests to ensure proper handling and routing. In addition, we upgraded backend systems to provide more robust error handling and observability.<br />",

          "body": "On April 24, 2024, between 10:26 and 16:30 UTC, the Pull Request page took longer than usual to enable a Pull Request to be merged. During the incident, the 75th percentile time to merge a pull request went from around 3 seconds to just over 6 minutes. We also saw slightly elevated error rates across the service, with an average error rate of 0.1%, peaking to 0.31% of requests. <br /><br />The underlying cause of the incident was a repeated problematic query that resulted in MySQL replicas crashing, which caused a back-up in the jobs that compute whether PRs can be merged.<br /><br />At 16:30 the incident self-mitigated when the volume of the problematic query decreased. Concurrent to this, we deployed a mitigation to remove the mergability polling code from the PR experience to alleviate pressure on MySQL servers. This mitigation caused the merge button to not automatically enable, but require a page refresh instead. At 17:40 we statused PRs again for this issue. We rolled back the mitigation to resolve the second incident at 18:20.<br /><br />Going forward, to improve mitigation we are investing in faster recovery from cascading read-replica crashes, improving query retry logic to more aggressively back off when read replicas are unhealthy, improving our ability to diagnose server crashes and trace them back to user activity, and making it easier to block problematic queries.<br /><br />To prevent recurrence, we are eliminating the query that caused the server to crash, improving our detection and mitigation of problematic queries, and investigating and remediating the underlying issues that caused MySQL to crash. We are also improving the merge button polling mechanism and mergeability background job to be resilient to this class of incident so customers can still merge PRs. <br />",

At 14:21 UTC on April 14th, community reports of this were confirmed and an incident declared. Emails most impacted by the delay were password reset and unrecognized device verification, which contain time-sensitive links or verification codes, and are required to be acted on in order for password resets or unrecognized logins to proceed. <br /><br />Users attempting to reset their password during the incident were unable to complete the reset. Users without two-factor authentication (2FA), signing in on an unrecognized device, were unable to complete device verification. Enterprise Managed Users, users with 2FA, and users on recognized devices or IP addresses were still able to sign in. This impacted 800-1000 user device verifications and 300-400 password resets. <br /><br />The mailer delays were caused by increased usage of a shared resource pool; a separate internal job queue became unhealthy and prevented the mailer queue from being worked on. <br /><br />We have made some immediate improvements to better detect and react to this type of situation again. As a short-term mitigation strategy, we have added a queue-bypass ability for  time-sensitive emails, like password reset and unrecognized device verification. We can enable this setting if we observe email delays reoccurring, which will ensure that future incidents do not affect user ability to complete critical login flows. We have paused the unhealthy job queue, to prevent impact to other queues using shared resources. And we have updated our methods of detection for anomalous email delivery, to identify this issue sooner.",

We mitigated the impact by failing the instance over to more capable hardware and shipping an improved version of the query that runs against read replicas. In response to this incident, we are also working to make performance improvements to the class of queries that most frequently resulted in failed requests during this timeframe.<br /><br />Web-based repository file editing saw a 17% failure rate during the incident with other repository management operations (e.g. rule updates, web-based branch creation, repository renames) seeing failure rates between 1.5% and 8%. API failure rates for these operations were higher.<br /><br />Issue and Pull Request authoring was heavily impacted during this incident due to reliance on the impacted database primary. We are continuing work to remove our dependence on this particular primary instance from our authoring workflows for these services.<br /><br />GitHub search saw a 5% failure rate throughout this incident due to reliance on the impacted primary database when authorizing repository access. The majority of failing requests were for search bar autocomplete with a limited number of search result failures as well.",

Additionally, 0.15% of Webhook deliveries were degraded due to an unrelated spike in database latency in a single availability zone. SLOs for Actions were 90% during the incident, but this was not evenly distributed across customers. We statused green after a long stretch of recovered SLOs, starting at April 4th, 2024 00:35 UTC. During this incident, we also had issues with incident tooling (https://www.githubstatus.com/) failing to update the public status page and occasionally not loading.<br /><br />The incident was resolved after the infrastructure issue was mitigated at 2024-04-04 04:27 UTC.<br /><br />We are working to improve monitoring and processes in response to this incident. We are investigating how we can improve resilience and our communication with our infrastructure provider, and how we can better handle ongoing incidents that are no longer impacting SLOs. We are also improving our incident tooling to ensure that the public status page is updated in a timely manner.",

This resulted in page edits not being reflected on those impacted sites.<br /><br />We deployed an application update that included a newer version of our database query builder. The new version uses a newer MySQL syntax for upsert queries that is not supported by the database proxy service we use for some of our production-environment database clusters. This incompatibility impacted the permissions cluster specifically, causing requests that attempted such queries to fail.<br /><br />We responded by rolling back the deployment, restoring the previous query use, and thus mitigated the incident.<br /><br />We have identified and corrected a misconfiguration of the permissions cluster in our development and CI environments that will ensure queries utilize the proxy service to prevent future syntax additions causing issues in production.<br />",

An internal component of our job queueing system was incorrectly handling invalid messages, resulting in stalled processing.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by shipping a fix to handle the edge case gracefully and allow processing to continue.<br /><br />Once the fix was deployed at 1:47 UTC, our systems fully caught up with pending background jobs at 1:58 UTC.<br /><br />We’re working to improve resiliency to invalid messages in our system to prevent future delays for these pull request updates.

During this incident, the following customer impacts occurred: API error rates as high as 1%, Copilot error rates as high as 17%, and Secret Scanning and 2FA using GitHub Mobile error rates as high as 100% followed by a drop in error rates to 30% starting at 22:55 UTC. This elevated error rate was due to a degradation of our centralized authentication service upon which many other services depend.<br /><br />The issue was caused by a deployment of network related configuration that was inadvertently applied to the incorrect environment. This error was detected within 4 minutes and a rollback was initiated. While error rates began dropping quickly at 22:55 UTC, the rollback failed in one of our data centers, leading to a longer recovery time. At this point, many failed requests succeeded upon retrying. This failure was due to an unrelated issue that had occurred earlier in the day where the datastore for our configuration service was polluted in a way that required manual intervention. The bad data in the configuration service caused the rollback in this one datacenter to fail. A manual removal of the incorrect data allowed the full rollback to complete at 00:48 UTC thereby restoring full access to services. We understand how the corrupt data was deployed and continue to investigate why the specific data caused the subsequent deployments to fail.<br /><br />We are working on various measures to ensure safety of this kind of configuration change, faster detection of the problem via better monitoring of the related subsystems, and improvements to the robustness of our underlying configuration system including prevention and automatic cleanup of polluted records such that we can automatically recover from this kind of data issue in the future.<br />",

          "body": "On March 11, 2024 between at 18:44 UTC and 19:10 UTC, GitHub Actions performance was degraded and some users experienced errors when trying to queue workflows. Approximately 3.7% of runs queued during this time were unable to start.<br /><br />The issue was partially caused by a deployment of an internal system Actions relies on to process workflow run events. The pausing of the queue processing during this deployment for about 3 minutes caused a spike in queued workflow runs. When this queue began to be processed, the high number of queued workflows overwhelmed a secret-initialization component of the workflow invocation system. The errors generated by this overwhelmed system ultimately delayed workflow invocation. Through our alerting system, we received initial indications of an issue at approximately 18:44 UTC. However, we did not initially see impact on our run start delays and run queuing availability metrics until approximately 18:52 UTC. As the large queue of workflow run events burned down, we saw recovery in our key customer impact measures by 19:11 UTC, but waited to declare the incident resolved at 19:22 UTC while verifying there was no further customer impact.<br /><br />We are working on various measures to reduce spikes in queue build up during deployments of our queueing system, and have scaled up the workers which handle secret generation and storage during the workflow invocation process.<br />",
