Make a free DockerHub account at https://hub.docker.com (or use an existing account if you have one).<br />2. Create a DockerHub secret/PAT from https://hub.docker.com/settings/security (Read permission should be sufficient).<br />3. Go to https://github.com/settings/codespaces<br /><br />Add three Codespace secrets:<br /><br />- DOCKERHUB_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD (equal to the DockerHub PAT you created)<br />- DOCKERHUB_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_SERVER (equal to https://index.docker.io/v1/)<br />- DOCKERHUB_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_USER (equal to your DockerHub username)<br /><br />4. Make sure these secrets are set as visible to the target repo.<br />5. Create/rebuild your Codespace<br /><br />Steps above are distilled from the official docs: https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/reference/allowing-your-codespace-to-access-a-private-registry#example-secrets",

The new error reporting that was implemented began raising on existing non-user facing errors that are handled further in the flow, at the controller level, which do not cause user impact.

          "body": "On May 21, 2024, between 11:40 UTC and 19:06 UTC various services experienced elevated latency due to a configuration change in an upstream cloud provider.<br /><br />GitHub Copilot Chat experienced P50 latency of up to 2.5s and P95 latency of up to 6s. GitHub Actions was degraded with 20 - 60 minute delays for workflow run updates. GitHub Enterprise Importer customers experienced longer migration run times due to GitHub Actions delays. Additionally, billing related metrics for budget notifications and UI reporting were delayed leading to outdated billing details. No data was lost and systems caught up after the incident. <br /><br />At 12:31 UTC, we detected increased latency to cloud hosts. At 14:09 UTC, non-critical traffic was paused, which did not result in restoration of service. At 14:27 UTC, we identified high CPU load within a network gateway cluster caused by a scheduled operating system upgrade that resulted in unintended, uneven distribution of traffic within the cluster. We initiated deployment of additional hosts at 16:35 UTC. Rebalancing completed by 17:58 UTC with system recovery observed at 18:03 UTC and completion at 19:06 UTC.<br /><br />We have identified gaps in our monitoring and alerting for load thresholds. We have prioritized these fixes to improve time to detection and mitigation of this class of issues.",

Actions jobs themselves were unaffected, this issue affected the timeliness of UI updates, with an average delay of 11m 40s and a maximum of 20m 14s.<br /><br />This incident was due to a performance problem on a single processing node, where Actions UI updates were being processed.  Additionally, a misconfigured monitor did not alert immediately, resulting in a 25m late detection time and a 37m total increase in time to mitigate.   <br /><br />We mitigated the incident by removing the problem node from the cluster and service was restored.

The root cause was identified to be a bug in the logic for checking the state of a configuration which would only manifest under very specific conditions and cause exceptions. These exceptions impacted the backend process for handling workflow run status updates and caused jobs with any annotations to not get updated properly. Jobs without any annotations were not affected. The affected jobs during the incident will get marked as failed after 24 hours, and affected customers will need to manually retry the jobs they want to execute.<br /><br />We resolved the incident by reverting the problematic change. We are enhancing our process for deploying changes and reassessing our monitoring of relevant subsystems to prevent similar issues in the future.<br />",

The problem was identified, and a status update was provided shortly after. A mitigation strategy was implemented by 14:30 UTC, which mitigated the impact.<br /><br />The root cause of the incident was a combination of issues in the request handling process. Specifically, some requests were malformed, which resulted in being incorrectly routed to the wrong deployment. That deployment wasn’t resilient to the malformed requests and resulted in errors.<br /><br />To mitigate the immediate impact, requests were routed away from the failing deployment. This temporarily reduced the number of errors while the underlying issue was investigated and resolved.<br /><br />To prevent similar incidents in the future, we have enhanced validation checks for incoming requests to ensure proper handling and routing. In addition, we upgraded backend systems to provide more robust error handling and observability.<br />",

          "body": "On April 24, 2024, between 10:26 and 16:30 UTC, the Pull Request page took longer than usual to enable a Pull Request to be merged. During the incident, the 75th percentile time to merge a pull request went from around 3 seconds to just over 6 minutes. We also saw slightly elevated error rates across the service, with an average error rate of 0.1%, peaking to 0.31% of requests. <br /><br />The underlying cause of the incident was a repeated problematic query that resulted in MySQL replicas crashing, which caused a back-up in the jobs that compute whether PRs can be merged.<br /><br />At 16:30 the incident self-mitigated when the volume of the problematic query decreased. Concurrent to this, we deployed a mitigation to remove the mergability polling code from the PR experience to alleviate pressure on MySQL servers. This mitigation caused the merge button to not automatically enable, but require a page refresh instead. At 17:40 we statused PRs again for this issue. We rolled back the mitigation to resolve the second incident at 18:20.<br /><br />Going forward, to improve mitigation we are investing in faster recovery from cascading read-replica crashes, improving query retry logic to more aggressively back off when read replicas are unhealthy, improving our ability to diagnose server crashes and trace them back to user activity, and making it easier to block problematic queries.<br /><br />To prevent recurrence, we are eliminating the query that caused the server to crash, improving our detection and mitigation of problematic queries, and investigating and remediating the underlying issues that caused MySQL to crash. We are also improving the merge button polling mechanism and mergeability background job to be resilient to this class of incident so customers can still merge PRs. <br />",

At 14:21 UTC on April 14th, community reports of this were confirmed and an incident declared. Emails most impacted by the delay were password reset and unrecognized device verification, which contain time-sensitive links or verification codes, and are required to be acted on in order for password resets or unrecognized logins to proceed. <br /><br />Users attempting to reset their password during the incident were unable to complete the reset. Users without two-factor authentication (2FA), signing in on an unrecognized device, were unable to complete device verification. Enterprise Managed Users, users with 2FA, and users on recognized devices or IP addresses were still able to sign in. This impacted 800-1000 user device verifications and 300-400 password resets. <br /><br />The mailer delays were caused by increased usage of a shared resource pool; a separate internal job queue became unhealthy and prevented the mailer queue from being worked on. <br /><br />We have made some immediate improvements to better detect and react to this type of situation again. As a short-term mitigation strategy, we have added a queue-bypass ability for  time-sensitive emails, like password reset and unrecognized device verification. We can enable this setting if we observe email delays reoccurring, which will ensure that future incidents do not affect user ability to complete critical login flows. We have paused the unhealthy job queue, to prevent impact to other queues using shared resources. And we have updated our methods of detection for anomalous email delivery, to identify this issue sooner.",

          "body": "Between 8:18 and 9:38 UTC on Wednesday, April 10th, customers experienced increased error rates across several services due to an overloaded primary database instance, ultimately caused by an unbounded query. We mitigated the impact by failing the instance over to more capable hardware and shipping an improved version of the query that runs against read replicas. In response to this incident, we are also working to make performance improvements to the class of queries that most frequently resulted in failed requests during this timeframe.<br /><br />Web-based repository file editing saw a 17% failure rate during the incident with other repository management operations (e.g. rule updates, web-based branch creation, repository renames) seeing failure rates between 1.5% and 8%. API failure rates for these operations were higher.<br /><br />Issue and Pull Request authoring was heavily impacted during this incident due to reliance on the impacted database primary. We are continuing work to remove our dependence on this particular primary instance from our authoring workflows for these services.<br /><br />GitHub search saw a 5% failure rate throughout this incident due to reliance on the impacted primary database when authorizing repository access. The majority of failing requests were for search bar autocomplete with a limited number of search result failures as well.",

Additionally, 0.15% of Webhook deliveries were degraded due to an unrelated spike in database latency in a single availability zone. SLOs for Actions were 90% during the incident, but this was not evenly distributed across customers. We statused green after a long stretch of recovered SLOs, starting at April 4th, 2024 00:35 UTC. During this incident, we also had issues with incident tooling (https://www.githubstatus.com/) failing to update the public status page and occasionally not loading.<br /><br />The incident was resolved after the infrastructure issue was mitigated at 2024-04-04 04:27 UTC.<br /><br />We are working to improve monitoring and processes in response to this incident. We are investigating how we can improve resilience and our communication with our infrastructure provider, and how we can better handle ongoing incidents that are no longer impacting SLOs. We are also improving our incident tooling to ensure that the public status page is updated in a timely manner.",

          "body": "On March 15, 2024, between 19:42 UTC and 20:24 UTC several services were degraded due to a regression in calling the permissions system. <br /><br />New GitHub Codespaces could not be created, as were Codespaces sessions that required minting a new auth token.<br /><br />Actions saw delays and infrastructure failures due to the upstream dependency on fetching tokens for the repository for runs to successfully execute. <br /><br />GitHub Pages were affected due to the impact on Actions, resulting in 1266 page builds failing, which at the low point represented 33% of page builds failing. This resulted in page edits not being reflected on those impacted sites.<br /><br />We deployed an application update that included a newer version of our database query builder. The new version uses a newer MySQL syntax for upsert queries that is not supported by the database proxy service we use for some of our production-environment database clusters. This incompatibility impacted the permissions cluster specifically, causing requests that attempted such queries to fail.<br /><br />We responded by rolling back the deployment, restoring the previous query use, and thus mitigated the incident.<br /><br />We have identified and corrected a misconfiguration of the permissions cluster in our development and CI environments that will ensure queries utilize the proxy service to prevent future syntax additions causing issues in production.<br />",

On average, 20% of Pull Requests page loads were out of sync and up to 30% of Pull Requests were impacted at peak. An internal component of our job queueing system was incorrectly handling invalid messages, resulting in stalled processing.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by shipping a fix to handle the edge case gracefully and allow processing to continue.<br /><br />Once the fix was deployed at 1:47 UTC, our systems fully caught up with pending background jobs at 1:58 UTC.<br /><br />We’re working to improve resiliency to invalid messages in our system to prevent future delays for these pull request updates. We are also reviewing our monitoring and observability to identify and remediate these types of failure cases faster.<br />",

          "body": "On March 11, 2024 starting at 22:45 UTC and ending on March 12, 2024 00:48 UTC various GitHub services were degraded and returned intermittent errors for users. During this incident, the following customer impacts occurred: API error rates as high as 1%, Copilot error rates as high as 17%, and Secret Scanning and 2FA using GitHub Mobile error rates as high as 100% followed by a drop in error rates to 30% starting at 22:55 UTC. This elevated error rate was due to a degradation of our centralized authentication service upon which many other services depend.<br /><br />The issue was caused by a deployment of network related configuration that was inadvertently applied to the incorrect environment. This error was detected within 4 minutes and a rollback was initiated. While error rates began dropping quickly at 22:55 UTC, the rollback failed in one of our data centers, leading to a longer recovery time. At this point, many failed requests succeeded upon retrying. This failure was due to an unrelated issue that had occurred earlier in the day where the datastore for our configuration service was polluted in a way that required manual intervention. The bad data in the configuration service caused the rollback in this one datacenter to fail. A manual removal of the incorrect data allowed the full rollback to complete at 00:48 UTC thereby restoring full access to services. We understand how the corrupt data was deployed and continue to investigate why the specific data caused the subsequent deployments to fail.<br /><br />We are working on various measures to ensure safety of this kind of configuration change, faster detection of the problem via better monitoring of the related subsystems, and improvements to the robustness of our underlying configuration system including prevention and automatic cleanup of polluted records such that we can automatically recover from this kind of data issue in the future.<br />",

          "body": "On March 11, 2024 between at 18:44 UTC and 19:10 UTC, GitHub Actions performance was degraded and some users experienced errors when trying to queue workflows. Approximately 3.7% of runs queued during this time were unable to start.<br /><br />The issue was partially caused by a deployment of an internal system Actions relies on to process workflow run events. The pausing of the queue processing during this deployment for about 3 minutes caused a spike in queued workflow runs. When this queue began to be processed, the high number of queued workflows overwhelmed a secret-initialization component of the workflow invocation system. The errors generated by this overwhelmed system ultimately delayed workflow invocation. Through our alerting system, we received initial indications of an issue at approximately 18:44 UTC. However, we did not initially see impact on our run start delays and run queuing availability metrics until approximately 18:52 UTC. As the large queue of workflow run events burned down, we saw recovery in our key customer impact measures by 19:11 UTC, but waited to declare the incident resolved at 19:22 UTC while verifying there was no further customer impact.<br /><br />We are working on various measures to reduce spikes in queue build up during deployments of our queueing system, and have scaled up the workers which handle secret generation and storage during the workflow invocation process.<br />",

This caused a drop in the amount of resources available in this cluster, which was mitigated by a redeployment.<br /><br />We have addressed the specific scenario to ensure resources are properly written and retrieved and added safeguards to ensure the deployment does not proceed if there is an issue of this type.  We are also reviewing our systems to more effectively route traffic toward healthy clusters during an outage and adding more safeguards on cluster resource adjustments.<br /><br />",

No data or jobs were lost.  From 14:17 to 14:41 UTC, there was a partial degradation, where customers would experience intermittent delays with PRs and Actions.  From 14:41 to 15:24 UTC, 36% of PRs users saw stale data, and 100% of in progress Actions workflows did not see updates , even though the workflows were succeeding.  At 15:24 UTC, we mitigated the incident by redeploying our service and jobs began to burn down, with full job catchup by 15:54 UTC. This was due to under provisioned memory and lack of memory based back pressure in the service, which overwhelmed consumers and led to OutOfMemory crashes.<br /><br />We have adjusted memory configurations to prevent this problem, and are analyzing and adjusting our alert sensitivity to reduce our time to detection of issues like this one in the future.<br />",

Nearly 95% of delays occurred between 11:05 and 11:27 UTC, with 5% during the remainder of the incident. During this incident, the following customer impacts occurred: 50% of webhooks experienced delays of up to 5m, 1% of webhooks experienced delays of 17m at peak; Actions: on average, 7% of customers experienced delays, with a peak of 44%; and many Issues saw a delay in appearing in searches. At 9:32 UTC our automated failover successfully routed traffic to a secondary cluster. But an improper restoration to primary at 10:32 UTC caused a significant increase in queued jobs until 11:21 UTC, when a correction was made and healthy services began burning down the backlog until full resolution.<br /><br />We have made improvements to the automation and reliability of our fallback process to prevent recurrence. We also have larger work already in progress to improve the overall reliability of our job processing platform.<br />",

          "body": "On February 26, 2024, between 18:34 UTC and 19:37 UTC our background job service was degraded and caused job start delays up to 15 minutes. Users experienced delays in Webhooks, Actions, and some UI updates (e.g. a delay in UI updates on pull requests). This was due to capacity problems with our job queueing service, and a failure of our automated failover system.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by manually failing over to our secondary cluster.   No data was lost - recovery began at 18:55 UTC, when the backlog of enqueued jobs began to process.<br /><br />We are actively working to repair our failover automation and expand the capacity of our background job queuing service to prevent issues like this in the future.<br />",

          "body": "This incident was the result of an infrastructure change that was made to our load balancers to prepare us for IPv6 enablement of GitHub.com. This change was deployed to a subset of our global edge sites.<br /><br />The change had the unintended consequence of causing IPv4 addresses to start being passed as an IPv4-mapped IPv6-compatible address to our IP Allow List functionality.<br /><br />For example 10.1.2.3 became ::ffff:10.1.2.3. While our IP Allow List functionality was developed with IPv6 in mind, it wasn't developed to handle these mapped addresses, and hence started blocking requests as it deemed these to be not in the defined list of allowed addresses. Request error rates peaked at 0.23% of all requests.<br /><br />We have so far identified three remediation items here:<br /><br />- Update the IP Allow List functionality to handle IPv4-mapped addresses.<br />- Audit the rest of our stack to confirm there are no further places this IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses flaw exists.<br />- Improve our testing and monitoring processes to better catch these issues in the future.",
