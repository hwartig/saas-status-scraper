During this period, the billing usage and budget pages were also inaccessible. Initially, we reported that GitHub Actions was affected, but we later determined that the impact was limited to jobs interacting with Packages services, while jobs that did not upload or download Packages remained unaffected.<br /><br />The incident occurred due to an error in newly introduced code, which caused containers to get into a bad state, ultimately leading to billing API calls failing with 503 errors. We mitigated the issue by rolling back the contributing change. In response to this incident, we are enhancing error handling, improving the resiliency of our billing API calls to minimize customer impact, and improving change rollout practices to catch these potential issues prior to deployment.",

At the peak of the incident the delay resulted in ~10% of all notifications taking over 10 minutes to be delivered, with the remaining ~90% being delivered within 5-10 minutes. This was due to insufficient capacity in worker pools as a result of increased load during peak hours.<br /><br />We also encountered delivery delays for a small number of webhooks, with delays of up-to 2.5 minutes to be delivered.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by scaling out the service to meet the demand.<br /><br />The increase in capacity gives us extra headroom, and we are working to improve our capacity planning to prevent issues like this occurring in the future.",

At peak impact, about 14% of uploads and downloads failed, and all Packages requests were delayed by an average of 7 seconds. The incident was caused by the rollout of a database configuration change that resulted in a degradation in database performance. We mitigated the incident by rolling back the contributing change and failing over the database. In response to this incident, we are tuning database configurations and resolving a source of deadlocks. We are also redistributing certain workloads to read replicas to reduce latency and enhance overall database performance.",

On average, 26% of jobs requiring large runners had a >5min delay getting a runner assigned.  This was caused by the rollback of a configuration change and a latent bug in event processing, which was triggered by the mixed data shape that resulted from the rollback.  The processing would reprocess the same events unnecessarily and cause the background job that manages large runner creation and deletion to run out of resources.  It would automatically restart and continue processing, but the jobs were not able to keep up with production traffic.  We mitigated the impact by using a feature flag to bypass the problematic event processing logic.  While these changes had been rolling out in stages over the last few months and had been safely rolled back previously, an unrelated change prevented rollback from causing this problem in earlier stages.<br /><br />We are reviewing and updating the feature flags in this event processing workflow to ensure that we have high confidence in rollback in all rollout stages.  We are also improving observability of the event processing to reduce the time to diagnose and mitigate similar issues going forward.",

Users with bad connections could not use impacted codespaces until they were stopped and restarted.<br /><br />This was caused by bad connections left behind after a deployment in an upstream dependency that the Codespaces service still provided to clients. The incident self-mitigated as new connections replaced stale ones. We are coordinating to ensure connection stability with future deployments of this nature.",

There was also an earlier period of impact from 2025-01-08 22:00 UTC to 2025-01-09 4:10 UTC with 488 jobs impacted.  The cause of both these delays was an incident in East US 2 impacting provisioning and network connectivity of Azure resources.  More details on that incident are visible at https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status/history (Tracking ID: PLP3-1W8). Because these runners are reliant on private networking with networks in the East US 2 region, there were no immediate mitigations available other than restoring network connectivity.  Going forward, we will continue evaluating options to provide better resilience to 3rd party regional outages that affect private networking customers.",

We mitigated the incident by re-routing Redis traffic out of that region at 07:49 UTC. We continued to monitor service recovery before resolving the incident at 08:30 UTC.

During the incident, Actions workflows triggered by the <i>on: pull_request</i> trigger for the <i>closed</i> type were not queued successfully because of these missing merge commit SHAs. Approximately 45,000 repositories experienced these missing workflow triggers in either of two possible scenarios: pull requests which were closed, but not merged; and pull requests which were merged. Impact was mitigated after rolling back the aforementioned feature flag. <br /><br />Merged pull requests that were affected have had their merge commit SHAs restored. Closed pull requests have not had their merge commit SHA restored; however, customers can re-open and close them again to recalculate this SHA. We are investigating methods to improve detection of these kinds of errors in the future.",

We mitigated the initial impact quickly by rolling back a feature flag. We will be improving the monitoring of our feature flag rollouts in the future to better catch these scenarios.",

The error rate was 8.5% on average and peaked at 44.3% of requests. The increased error rate caused a broad impact across our services, such as the inability to log in, view a repository, open a pull request, and comment on issues. The errors were caused by our web servers being overloaded as a result of planned maintenance that unintentionally caused our live updates service to fail to start. As a result of the live updates service being down, clients reconnected aggressively and overloaded our servers.<br /><br />We only marked Issues as affected during this incident despite the broad impact. This oversight was due to a gap in our alerting while our web servers were overloaded. The engineering team's focus on restoring functionality led us to not identify the broad scope of the impact to customers until the incident had already been mitigated.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by rolling back the changes from the planned maintenance to the live updates service and scaling up the service to handle the influx of traffic from WebSocket clients.<br /><br />We are working to reduce the impact of the live updates service's availability on github.com to prevent issues like this one in the future. We are also working to improve our alerting to better detect the scope of impact from incidents like this.",

Web and API requests for Pull Requests experienced a 3.5% error rate and Issues had a 1.2% error rate. The highest impact was for users who experienced errors while creating and commenting on Pull Requests and Issues. Actions had a 3.3% error rate in jobs and delays on some updates during this time.<br /><br />This was due to an erroneous database credential change impacting write access to Issues and Pull Requests data. We mitigated the incident by reverting the credential change at 19:52 UTC. We continued to monitor service recovery before resolving the incident at 20:05 UTC. <br /><br />There are a few improvements we are making in response to this. We are investing in safe guards to the change management process in order to prevent erroneous database credential changes. Additionally, the initial rollback attempt was unsuccessful which led to a longer time to mitigate. We were able to revert through an alternative method and are updating our playbooks to document this mitigation strategy.",

This was a shorter recurrence of the issue that occurred the previous day.  Users would see workflows queued waiting for a large runner.  On average, 13.5% of all workflows requiring large runners over the incident time were affected, peaking at 46% of requests. Standard and Mac runners were not affected.<br /><br />Following the Dec 1 incident, we had disabled non-critical paths in the provisioning job and believed that would eliminate any impact while we understood and addressed the timeouts.  Unfortunately, the timeouts were a symptom of broader job health issues, so those changes did not prevent this second occurrence the following day.  We now understand that other jobs on these agents had issues that resulted in them hanging and consuming available job agent capacity.  The reduced capacity led to saturation of the remaining agents and significant performance degradation in the running jobs.<br /><br />In addition to the immediate improvements shared in the previous incident summary, we immediately initiated regular recycles of all agents in this area while we continue to address the issues in both the jobs themselves and the resiliency of the agents.  We also continue to improve our detection to ensure we are automatically detecting these delays.",

          "body": "Between Dec 1 12:20 UTC and Dec 2 1:05 UTC, availability of large hosted runners for Actions was degraded due to failures in background VM provisioning jobs. Users would see workflows queued waiting for a runner.  On average, 8% of all workflows requiring large runners over the incident time were affected, peaking at 37.5% of requests.  There were also lower levels of intermittent queuing on Dec 1 beginning around 3:00 UTC.  Standard and Mac runners were not affected. <br /><br />The job failures were caused by timeouts to a dependent service in the VM provisioning flow and gaps in the jobs’ resilience to those timeouts.  The incident was mitigated by circumventing the dependency as it was not in the critical path of VM provisioning.<br /><br />There are a few immediate improvements we are making in response to this.  We are addressing the causes of the failed calls to improve the availability of calls to that backend service.  Even with that impact, the critical flow of large VM provisioning should not have been impacted, so we are improving the client behavior to fail fast and circuit break non-critical calls.  Finally the alerting for this service was not adequate in this particular scenario to ensure fast response by our team.  We are improving our automated detection from this to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.",

Attempts to recover the database led to cascading failures that impacted the DNS systems for that site. The team worked to restore the infrastructure and there was no customer impact until 17:31 UTC. <br /><br />During the incident, impact to the following services could be observed:<br /><br />- Copilot: Degradation in IDE code completions for 4% of active users during the incident from 17:31 UTC to 21:45 UTC.<br />- Actions: Workflow runs delay (25% of runs delayed by over 5 minutes) and errors (1%) between 20:28 UTC and 21:30 UTC. Errors while creating Artifact Attestations.<br />- Customer migrations: From 18:16 UTC to 23:12 UTC running migrations stopped and new ones were not able to start.<br />- Support: support.github.com was unavailable from 19:28 UTC to 22:14 UTC. <br />- Code search: 100% of queries failed between 2024-10-11 20:16 UTC and 2024-10-12 00:46 UTC.<br /><br />Starting at 18:05 UTC, engineering attempted to repoint the degraded site DNS to a different site to restore DNS functionality. At 18:26 UTC the test system had validated this approach and a progressive rollout to the affected hosts proceeded over the next hour. While this mitigation was effective at restoring connectivity within the site, it caused issues with connectivity from healthy sites back to the degraded site, and the team proceeded to plan out a different remediation effort.<br /><br />At 20:52 UTC, the team finalized a remediation plan and began the next phase of mitigation by deploying temporary DNS resolution capabilities to the degraded site. At 21:46 UTC, DNS resolution in the degraded site began to recover and was fully healthy at 22:16 UTC. Lingering issues with code search were resolved at 01:11 UTC on October 12.<br /><br />The team continued to restore the original functionality within the site after public service functionality was restored. GitHub is working to harden our resiliency and automation processes around this infrastructure to make diagnosing and resolving issues like this faster in the future.",

Additionally, there was no impact to customers in other regions.<br /><br />The cause was traced to storage capacity constraints in the region and was mitigated by temporarily redirecting create requests to other regions. Afterwards, additional storage capacity was added to the region and traffic was routed back. <br /><br />A bug was also identified that caused some available capacity to not be utilized, artificially constraining capacity and halting creations in the region prematurely. We have since fixed this bug as well, so that available capacity scales as expected according to our capacity planning projections.",
