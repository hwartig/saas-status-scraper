The backfilled metadata will be available in a few days.<br /><br />Until the backfill is complete, there are several actions you can take to ensure an Action runs:<br />- Any Actions that should have run on closed but not merged PRs can be triggered by re-opening and re-closing the PR.<br />- Actions that should have run on PR merge can be re-run from the main branch of your repository.<br /><br />The only Actions that cannot be re-run at this time are ones that specifically use the merge commit.<br /><br />Additionally, the `merge_commit_sha` field on an impacted Pull Request will be `null` when queried via our API until the backfill completes.<br /><br />We appreciate the error reports we received, and thank you for your patience. We mitigated the initial impact quickly by rolling back a feature flag. We will be improving the monitoring of our feature flag rollouts in the future to better catch these scenarios.",

The error rate was 8.5% on average and peaked at 44.3% of requests. The increased error rate caused a broad impact across our services, such as the inability to log in, view a repository, open a pull request, and comment on issues. The errors were caused by our web servers being overloaded as a result of planned maintenance that unintentionally caused our live updates service to fail to start. As a result of the live updates service being down, clients reconnected aggressively and overloaded our servers.<br /><br />We only marked Issues as affected during this incident despite the broad impact. This oversight was due to a gap in our alerting while our web servers were overloaded. The engineering team's focus on restoring functionality led us to not identify the broad scope of the impact to customers until the incident had already been mitigated.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by rolling back the changes from the planned maintenance to the live updates service and scaling up the service to handle the influx of traffic from WebSocket clients.<br /><br />We are working to reduce the impact of the live updates service's availability on github.com to prevent issues like this one in the future. We are also working to improve our alerting to better detect the scope of impact from incidents like this.",

This led to an increase in overall load on a shared database cluster, resulting in a cascading effect on multiple services and specifically affecting repository access authorization checks. We mitigated the incident after rolling back the change at 19:07 UTC, fully recovering within 4 minutes. <br /><br />While this incident was caught and remedied quickly, we are implementing process improvements around recognizing and reducing risk of changes involving high volume authorization checks. We are investing in broad improvements to our safe rollout process, such as improving early detection mechanisms.",

The highest impact was for users who experienced errors while creating and commenting on Pull Requests and Issues. Actions had a 3.3% error rate in jobs and delays on some updates during this time.<br /><br />This was due to an erroneous database credential change impacting write access to Issues and Pull Requests data. We mitigated the incident by reverting the credential change at 19:52 UTC. We continued to monitor service recovery before resolving the incident at 20:05 UTC. <br /><br />There are a few improvements we are making in response to this. We are investing in safe guards to the change management process in order to prevent erroneous database credential changes. Additionally, the initial rollback attempt was unsuccessful which led to a longer time to mitigate. We were able to revert through an alternative method and are updating our playbooks to document this mitigation strategy.",

On average, 13.5% of all workflows requiring large runners over the incident time were affected, peaking at 46% of requests. Standard and Mac runners were not affected.<br /><br />Following the Dec 1 incident, we had disabled non-critical paths in the provisioning job and believed that would eliminate any impact while we understood and addressed the timeouts.  Unfortunately, the timeouts were a symptom of broader job health issues, so those changes did not prevent this second occurrence the following day.  We now understand that other jobs on these agents had issues that resulted in them hanging and consuming available job agent capacity.  The reduced capacity led to saturation of the remaining agents and significant performance degradation in the running jobs.<br /><br />In addition to the immediate improvements shared in the previous incident summary, we immediately initiated regular recycles of all agents in this area while we continue to address the issues in both the jobs themselves and the resiliency of the agents.  We also continue to improve our detection to ensure we are automatically detecting these delays.",

The incident was mitigated by circumventing the dependency as it was not in the critical path of VM provisioning.<br /><br />There are a few immediate improvements we are making in response to this.  We are addressing the causes of the failed calls to improve the availability of calls to that backend service.  Even with that impact, the critical flow of large VM provisioning should not have been impacted, so we are improving the client behavior to fail fast and circuit break non-critical calls.  Finally the alerting for this service was not adequate in this particular scenario to ensure fast response by our team.  We are improving our automated detection from this to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.",

Attempts to recover the database led to cascading failures that impacted the DNS systems for that site. The team worked to restore the infrastructure and there was no customer impact until 17:31 UTC. <br /><br />During the incident, impact to the following services could be observed:<br /><br />- Copilot: Degradation in IDE code completions for 4% of active users during the incident from 17:31 UTC to 21:45 UTC.<br />- Actions: Workflow runs delay (25% of runs delayed by over 5 minutes) and errors (1%) between 20:28 UTC and 21:30 UTC. Errors while creating Artifact Attestations.<br />- Customer migrations: From 18:16 UTC to 23:12 UTC running migrations stopped and new ones were not able to start.<br />- Support: support.github.com was unavailable from 19:28 UTC to 22:14 UTC. <br />- Code search: 100% of queries failed between 2024-10-11 20:16 UTC and 2024-10-12 00:46 UTC.<br /><br />Starting at 18:05 UTC, engineering attempted to repoint the degraded site DNS to a different site to restore DNS functionality. At 18:26 UTC the test system had validated this approach and a progressive rollout to the affected hosts proceeded over the next hour. While this mitigation was effective at restoring connectivity within the site, it caused issues with connectivity from healthy sites back to the degraded site, and the team proceeded to plan out a different remediation effort.<br /><br />At 20:52 UTC, the team finalized a remediation plan and began the next phase of mitigation by deploying temporary DNS resolution capabilities to the degraded site. At 21:46 UTC, DNS resolution in the degraded site began to recover and was fully healthy at 22:16 UTC. Lingering issues with code search were resolved at 01:11 UTC on October 12.<br /><br />The team continued to restore the original functionality within the site after public service functionality was restored. GitHub is working to harden our resiliency and automation processes around this infrastructure to make diagnosing and resolving issues like this faster in the future.",

Additionally, there was no impact to customers in other regions.<br /><br />The cause was traced to storage capacity constraints in the region and was mitigated by temporarily redirecting create requests to other regions. Afterwards, additional storage capacity was added to the region and traffic was routed back. <br /><br />A bug was also identified that caused some available capacity to not be utilized, artificially constraining capacity and halting creations in the region prematurely. We have since fixed this bug as well, so that available capacity scales as expected according to our capacity planning projections.",

Approximately 1,100 runs were delayed long enough to get marked as abandoned. The runs that weren't abandoned completed successfully after we recovered from the incident. Actions jobs experienced average delays of 23 minutes, with some jobs experiencing delays as high as 45 minutes. During the course of the incident, 17% of runs were delayed by more than 5 minutes. At peak, as many as 80% of runs experienced delays exceeding 5 minutes. The root cause was a misconfiguration in the service that manages runner connections, which caused CPU throttling and led to a performance degradation in that service.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by diverting runner connections away from the misconfigured nodes. We are working to improve our internal monitoring and alerting to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.",

The overall SSH error rate during this period was 0.0005%, with a peak error rate of 0.3%.\n\nThe root cause was traced to a regression in the service reload mechanism, which resulted in SSH hosts dropping connections on an hourly basis. As SSH hosts were rebooted for routine security updates, the issue progressively affected more hosts.\n\nTo mitigate the impact, we removed the affected hosts from production traffic. The SSH regression has since been identified and resolved, with all SSH hosts fully restored. Additionally, we have implemented new monitoring to alert us of any SSH connection refusals moving forward.",

At 05:24 UTC, we implemented a mitigation to shift traffic to healthy infrastructure and new Actions Runs resumed normal operations. During the rest of the incident window, Actions runs started before 05:24 UTC continued to see delays publishing logs or job results.  No Actions runs or Webhook deliveries were lost, only delayed.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by immediately shifting traffic to a healthy cluster while investigating. The incident was caused by an erroneous configuration change on our eventing platform. A permanent fix was deployed at 06:22 UTC after which services began to recover and burn down their backed up queues, with full recovery by 07:13 UTC.<br /><br />We are working to reduce our time to detection and develop test automation to prevent issues like this one in the future.<br />",

This specifically impacted GHES customers who were enabling GitHub Connect for the first time on a GHES instance. Previously enabled GitHub Connect GHES instances were not impacted by this issue.<br /><br />Customers experiencing this issue would have received a 404 response during GitHub Connect enablement and subsequent messages about a failure to connect. This was due to a recent change in configuration to GitHub Connect which has since been rolled back. <br /><br />Subsequent enablement failures on re-attempts were caused by data corruption which has been remediated. Customers should now be able to enable GitHub Connect successfully.<br /><br />To reduce our time to detection and mitigation of such issues in the future, we are working to improve observability of GitHub Connect failures. We are also making efforts to prevent future misconfiguration of GitHub Connect.",

On average, 2.5% of workflow runs failed to start with the failure rate peaking at 6%. In addition we saw a 1% error rate for Actions API endpoints. This was due to an Actions service being deployed to faulty hardware that had an incorrect memory configuration, leading to significant performance degradation of those pods due to insufficient memory.<br /><br />The impact was mitigated when the pods were evicted automatically and moved to healthy hosts. The faulty hardware was disabled to prevent a recurrence. We are improving our health checks to ensure that unhealthy hardware is consistently marked offline automatically. We are also improving our monitoring and deployment practices to reduce our time to detection and automated mitigation at the service layer for issues like this in the future.",

On average, 25% of workflow runs were delayed by 8 minutes. Less than 1% of workflow runs exhausted retries and failed to start. The issue stemmed from a backlog of Pull Request events which caused delays in Actions processing the event queues that trigger workflow runs.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by disabling the process that led to the sudden spike in Pull Request events. We are working to improve our monitoring and deployment practices to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.

There was no data loss or corruption during this incident.<br /> <br />At 22:59 UTC an erroneous configuration change rolled out to all GitHub.com databases that impacted the ability of the database to respond to health check pings from the routing service. As a result, the routing service could not detect healthy databases to route application traffic to. This led to widespread impact on GitHub.com starting at 23:02 UTC.<br /> <br />We mitigated the incident by reverting the change and confirming restored connectivity to our databases. At 23:38 UTC, traffic resumed and all services recovered to full health. Out of an abundance of caution, we continued to monitor before resolving the incident at 00:30 UTC on August 15th, 2024.<br /> <br />To prevent recurrence we are implementing additional guardrails in our database change management process.

This was due to a partial rollout of a caching layer for Copilot licensing checks. During the rollout, connections to the caching layer were overwhelmed causing the licensing checks to timeout. Many pages were impacted by this failure due to a lack of resiliency to the timeouts.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by reverting the rollout of the caching layer 11 minutes after initial detection. This immediately restored functionality for affected users.<br /><br />We are working to gracefully degrade experiences during these types of failures and reduce dependencies across services that may cause these types of failures in the future.<br />",

Runners without VNet Injection or those with VNet Injection in other regions were not affected. The issue was caused due to an outage in a third party provider blocking a large percentage of VM allocations in the East US 2 region. Once the underlying issue with the third party provider was resolved, job queue times went back to normal. We are exploring the addition of support for customers to define VNet Injection Runners with VNets across multiple regions to minimize the impact of outages in a single region.",
