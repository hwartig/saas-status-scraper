Runners without VNet Injection or those with VNet Injection in other regions were not affected. The issue was caused due to an outage in a third party provider blocking a large percentage of VM allocations in the East US 2 region. Once the underlying issue with the third party provider was resolved, job queue times went back to normal. We are exploring the addition of support for customers to define VNet Injection Runners with VNets across multiple regions to minimize the impact of outages in a single region.",

Team creation and team edits would appear to function as normal, but the selected group would not be linked to the team after form submission. This was due to a bug in the Primer experimental SelectPanel component that was mistakenly rolled out to customers via a feature flag.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by scaling the feature flag back down to 0% of actors.<br /><br />We are making improvements to our release process and test coverage to avoid similar incidents in the future.",

          "body": "Beginning on July 18, 2024 at 22:38 UTC, network issues within an upstream provider led to degraded experiences across Actions, Copilot, and Pages services.<br /><br />Up to 50% of Actions workflow jobs were stuck in the queuing state, including Pages deployments.  Users were also not able to enable Actions or register self-hosted runners. This was caused by an unreachable backend resource in the Central US region. That resource is configured for geo-replication, but the replication configuration prevented resiliency when one region was unavailable. Updating the replication configuration mitigated the impact by allowing successful requests while one region was unavailable. By July 19 00:12 UTC, users saw some improvement in Actions jobs and full recovery of Pages. Standard hosted runners and self-hosted Actions workflows were healthy by 2:10 UTC and large hosted runners fully recovered at 2:38.<br /><br />Copilot requests were also impacted with up to 2% of Copilot Chat requests and 0.5% of Copilot Completions requests resulting in errors. Chat requests were routed to other regions after 20 minutes while Completions requests took 45 minutes to reroute. <br /><br />We have identified improvements to detection to reduce the time to engage all impacted on-call teams and improvements to our replication configuration and failover workflows to be more resilient to unhealthy dependencies and reduce our time to failover and mitigate customer impact.",

On average, the error rate was 0.3% for requests to github.com and the API, and 3.0% of requests for Packages. This incident was triggered by two unrelated events:<br /><br />- A planned testing event of an internal feature caused heavy loads on our databases, disrupting services across GitHub.<br />- A network configuration change deployed to support capacity expansion in a GitHub data center. <br /><br />We partially resolved the incident by aborting the testing event at 16:17 UTC and fully resolved the incident by rolling back the network configuration changes at 16:49 UTC. <br /><br />We have paused all planned capacity expansion activity within GitHub data centers until we have stabilized the root cause of this incident. In addition, we are reexamining our load testing practices so they can be done in a safer environment and making architectural changes to the feature that caused issues.<br />",

Between 01:00 and 02:00 UTC we were able to reroute traffic for Chat to bring error rates below 6%. During the time of impact customers would have seen delayed responses, errors, or timeouts during requests. GitHub code scanning autofix jobs were also delayed during this incident. <br /><br />A resource cleanup job was scheduled by <a href=\"https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status/history?trackingid=4L44-3F0\">Azure OpenAI (AOAI) service early July 13th</a> targeting a resource group thought to only contain unused resources. This resource group unintentionally contained critical, still in use, resources that were then removed. The cleanup job was halted before removing all resources in the resource group. Enough resources remained that GitHub was able to mitigate while resources were reconstructed.<br /><br />We are working with AOAI to ensure mitigation is in place to prevent future impact. In addition, we will improve traffic rerouting processes to reduce time to mitigate in the future.",

          "body": "On July 5, 2024, between 16:31 UTC and 18:08 UTC, the Webhooks service was degraded, with customer impact of delays to all webhook delivery. On average, delivery delays were 24 minutes, with a maximum of 71 minutes. This was caused by a configuration change to the Webhooks service, which led to unauthenticated requests sent to the background job cluster. The configuration error was repaired and re-deploying the service solved the issue. However, this created a thundering herd effect which overloaded the background job queue cluster which put its API layer at max capacity, resulting in timeouts for other job clients, which presented as increased latency for API calls.<br /><br />Shortly after resolving the authentication misconfiguration, we had a separate issue in the background job processing service where health probes were failing, leading to reduced capacity in the background job API layer which magnified the effects of the thundering herd. From 18:21 UTC to 21:14 UTC, Actions runs on PRs experienced approximately 2 minutes delay and maximum of 12 minutes delay. A deployment of the background job processing service remediated the issue.<br /><br />To reduce our time to detection, we have streamlined our dashboards and added alerting for this specific runtime behavior. Additionally, we are working to reduce the blast radius of background job incidents through better workload isolation.<br />",

          "body": "On June 28th, 2024, at 16:06 UTC, a backend update by GitHub triggered a significant number of long-running Organization membership update jobs in our job processing system. The job queue depth rose as these update jobs consumed most of our job worker capacity. This resulted in delays for other jobs across services such as Pull Requests and PR-related Actions workflows. We mitigated the impact to Pull Requests and Actions at 19:32 UTC by pausing all Organization membership update jobs. We deployed a code change at 22:30 UTC to skip over the jobs queued by the backend change and re-enabled Organization membership update jobs. We restored the Organization membership update functionality at 22:52 UTC, including all membership changes queued during the incident.<br /><br />During the incident, about 15% of Action workflow runs experienced a delay of more than five minutes. In addition, Pull Requests had delays in determining merge eligibility and starting associated Action workflows for the duration of the incident. Organization membership updates saw delays for upwards of five hours.<br /><br />To prevent a similar event in the future from impacting our users, we are working to: improve our job management system to better manage our job worker capacity; add more precise monitoring for job delays; and strengthen our testing practices to prevent future recurrences.",

These events indicate when an issue was added to or removed from a project and when their status changed within a project. The data couldnâ€™t be loaded due to a misconfiguration of the service backing these events. This happened after a scheduled secret rotation when the wrongly configured service continued using the old secrets which had expired. <br /><br />We mitigated the incident by remediating the service configuration and have started simplifying the configuration to avoid similar misconfigurations in the future.",

Other Copilot chat experiences were unaffected during this time.<br /><br />The incident was mitigated by rotating the certificate in question.<br /><br />To prevent future incidents, we are working to reduce our time to detect and have removed certificate-based dependencies between these internal systems in the process.<br />",

Make a free DockerHub account at https://hub.docker.com (or use an existing account if you have one).<br />2. Create a DockerHub secret/PAT from https://hub.docker.com/settings/security (Read permission should be sufficient).<br />3. Go to https://github.com/settings/codespaces<br /><br />Add three Codespace secrets:<br /><br />- DOCKERHUB_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD (equal to the DockerHub PAT you created)<br />- DOCKERHUB_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_SERVER (equal to https://index.docker.io/v1/)<br />- DOCKERHUB_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_USER (equal to your DockerHub username)<br /><br />4. Make sure these secrets are set as visible to the target repo.<br />5. Create/rebuild your Codespace<br /><br />Steps above are distilled from the official docs: https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/reference/allowing-your-codespace-to-access-a-private-registry#example-secrets",

The new error reporting that was implemented began raising on existing non-user facing errors that are handled further in the flow, at the controller level, which do not cause user impact. We are working to improve our reporting roll out process to reduce issues like this in the future which includes updating monitors and dashboards to exclude this class of error.

GitHub Actions was degraded with 20 - 60 minute delays for workflow run updates. GitHub Enterprise Importer customers experienced longer migration run times due to GitHub Actions delays. Additionally, billing related metrics for budget notifications and UI reporting were delayed leading to outdated billing details. No data was lost and systems caught up after the incident. <br /><br />At 12:31 UTC, we detected increased latency to cloud hosts. At 14:09 UTC, non-critical traffic was paused, which did not result in restoration of service. At 14:27 UTC, we identified high CPU load within a network gateway cluster caused by a scheduled operating system upgrade that resulted in unintended, uneven distribution of traffic within the cluster. We initiated deployment of additional hosts at 16:35 UTC. Rebalancing completed by 17:58 UTC with system recovery observed at 18:03 UTC and completion at 19:06 UTC.<br /><br />We have identified gaps in our monitoring and alerting for load thresholds.

Actions jobs themselves were unaffected, this issue affected the timeliness of UI updates, with an average delay of 11m 40s and a maximum of 20m 14s.<br /><br />This incident was due to a performance problem on a single processing node, where Actions UI updates were being processed.  Additionally, a misconfigured monitor did not alert immediately, resulting in a 25m late detection time and a 37m total increase in time to mitigate.   <br /><br />We mitigated the incident by removing the problem node from the cluster and service was restored.

          "body": "On May 14, 2024 between 18:00 UTC and 20:10 UTC, GitHub Actions performance was degraded and larger hosted runners using <code>linux-x64</code> images (Ubuntu20, Ubuntu22, Ubuntu24-beta) experienced longer than normal job start up times. Approximately 25% of all runs targeting larger hosted runners queued during this time were slow to start, with a median wait time of 1 minute, 55 seconds.<br /><br />The issue was caused by a downstream dependency overloading, which impacted our machine setup process. Each larger hosted runner job is run on a fresh VM, and one of the setup steps is installing the Actions agent. Up to the point of this incident, we would pull the latest agent version from the GitHub release and install it on the VM. However, during this incident the speciific GitHub release for the Linux x64 Actions agent became overloaded, and our agent downloads were severely throttled. This throttling led to timeouts during the download, and caused our hosted runner system to conclude the VMs were failing to start. We need the Actions agent online to start serving jobs, and with the download timing out, our service assumed the runner wasn't starting up successfully. This failure to start up led to those VMs being reset again and again instead of serving jobs. We mitigated the issue by falling back to a cached version of the Actions agent present on our image.<br /><br />We have further refined the fallback system to automatically use the cached agent binaries, and added new functionality to allow for easier agent downloading from other locations. Both of these measures should eliminate future impacts from similar downstream impact.",

The root cause was identified to be a bug in the logic for checking the state of a configuration which would only manifest under very specific conditions and cause exceptions. These exceptions impacted the backend process for handling workflow run status updates and caused jobs with any annotations to not get updated properly. Jobs without any annotations were not affected. The affected jobs during the incident will get marked as failed after 24 hours, and affected customers will need to manually retry the jobs they want to execute.<br /><br />We resolved the incident by reverting the problematic change. We are enhancing our process for deploying changes and reassessing our monitoring of relevant subsystems to prevent similar issues in the future.<br />",

The problem was identified, and a status update was provided shortly after. A mitigation strategy was implemented by 14:30 UTC, which mitigated the impact.<br /><br />The root cause of the incident was a combination of issues in the request handling process. Specifically, some requests were malformed, which resulted in being incorrectly routed to the wrong deployment. That deployment wasnâ€™t resilient to the malformed requests and resulted in errors.<br /><br />To mitigate the immediate impact, requests were routed away from the failing deployment. This temporarily reduced the number of errors while the underlying issue was investigated and resolved.<br /><br />To prevent similar incidents in the future, we have enhanced validation checks for incoming requests to ensure proper handling and routing. In addition, we upgraded backend systems to provide more robust error handling and observability.<br />",

This was due to an incorrect configuration of our Azure Marketplace offering causing the images to be no longer visible to Azure users.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by working with our partners in Azure to restore access to the affected images.<br /><br />We are working with our partners in Azure to add additional safeguards to ensure our images remain available to customers at all times. In addition, we continue to work with on restoring access to some older patch versions of GHES that remain unavailable at this time.",

          "body": "On April 24, 2024, between 10:26 and 16:30 UTC, the Pull Request page took longer than usual to enable a Pull Request to be merged. During the incident, the 75th percentile time to merge a pull request went from around 3 seconds to just over 6 minutes. We also saw slightly elevated error rates across the service, with an average error rate of 0.1%, peaking to 0.31% of requests. <br /><br />The underlying cause of the incident was a repeated problematic query that resulted in MySQL replicas crashing, which caused a back-up in the jobs that compute whether PRs can be merged.<br /><br />At 16:30 the incident self-mitigated when the volume of the problematic query decreased. Concurrent to this, we deployed a mitigation to remove the mergability polling code from the PR experience to alleviate pressure on MySQL servers. This mitigation caused the merge button to not automatically enable, but require a page refresh instead. At 17:40 we statused PRs again for this issue. We rolled back the mitigation to resolve the second incident at 18:20.<br /><br />Going forward, to improve mitigation we are investing in faster recovery from cascading read-replica crashes, improving query retry logic to more aggressively back off when read replicas are unhealthy, improving our ability to diagnose server crashes and trace them back to user activity, and making it easier to block problematic queries.<br /><br />To prevent recurrence, we are eliminating the query that caused the server to crash, improving our detection and mitigation of problematic queries, and investigating and remediating the underlying issues that caused MySQL to crash. We are also improving the merge button polling mechanism and mergeability background job to be resilient to this class of incident so customers can still merge PRs. <br />",

At 14:21 UTC on April 14th, community reports of this were confirmed and an incident declared. Emails most impacted by the delay were password reset and unrecognized device verification, which contain time-sensitive links or verification codes, and are required to be acted on in order for password resets or unrecognized logins to proceed. <br /><br />Users attempting to reset their password during the incident were unable to complete the reset. Users without two-factor authentication (2FA), signing in on an unrecognized device, were unable to complete device verification. Enterprise Managed Users, users with 2FA, and users on recognized devices or IP addresses were still able to sign in. This impacted 800-1000 user device verifications and 300-400 password resets. <br /><br />The mailer delays were caused by increased usage of a shared resource pool; a separate internal job queue became unhealthy and prevented the mailer queue from being worked on. <br /><br />We have made some immediate improvements to better detect and react to this type of situation again. As a short-term mitigation strategy, we have added a queue-bypass ability for  time-sensitive emails, like password reset and unrecognized device verification. We can enable this setting if we observe email delays reoccurring, which will ensure that future incidents do not affect user ability to complete critical login flows. We have paused the unhealthy job queue, to prevent impact to other queues using shared resources. And we have updated our methods of detection for anomalous email delivery, to identify this issue sooner.",

All Pages deployments failed for the duration of the incident. Git Systems saw approximately 12% of raw file download requests and 16% of repository archive download requests return HTTP 50X error codes for the duration of the incident. Issues experienced increased latency for issue creation and updates. Codespaces saw roughly 500 requests to create and resume a Codespace timeout during the incident.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by rolling back the offending query.
