The incident was caused by an outage in a downstream dependency that led to failures in backend service connectivity in one region. At 03:59 UTC, we evacuated a majority of services in the impacted region, but some users may have seen ongoing impact until all services were fully evacuated at 06:14 UTC. We are working to improve monitoring and processes of failover to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.",

Users experienced inaccurate or incomplete results, failures to load certain pages (like Issues, Pull Requests, Projects, and Deployments), and broken components like Actions workflow and label filters.<br /><br />Most user impact occurred between 14:00 UTC and 15:30 UTC, when up to 75% of search queries failed, and updates to search results were delayed by up to 100 minutes. <br /><br />The incident was triggered by intermittent connectivity issues between our load balancers and search hosts. While retry logic initially masked these problems, retry queues eventually overwhelmed the load balancers, causing failure. The query failures were mitigated at 15:30 UTC after throttling our search indexing pipeline to reduce load and stabilize retries.  The connectivity failures were resolved at 17:14 UTC after the automated reboot of a search host, causing the rest of the system to recover.  <br /><br />We have improved internal monitors and playbooks, and tuned our search cluster load balancer to further mitigate the recurrence of this failure mode. We continue to invest in resolving the underlying connectivity issues.",

This change led to an unexpected spike in connection attempts to our datastore and saturated its connection backlog and resulted in intermittent failures to serve required UI content.

While the column was no longer in direct use, our ORM continued to reference the dropped column in a subset of pull request queries. As a result, there were elevated error rates across pushes, webhooks, notifications, and pull requests with impact peaking at approximately 4% of all web and REST API traffic. <br /><br />We mitigated the issue by deploying a change that instructed the ORM to ignore the removed column. Most affected services recovered by 16:13 UTC. However, that fix was applied only to our largest production environment. An update to some of our custom and canary environments did not pick up the fix and this triggered a secondary incident affecting ~0.1% of pull request traffic, which was fully resolved by 19:45 UTC.<br /><br />While migrations have protections such as progressive roll-out first targeting validation environments and acknowledge gates, this incident identified an application monitoring gap that would have prevented continued rollout when impact was observed. We will add additional automation and safeguards to prevent future incidents without requiring human intervention. We are also already working on a way to streamline some types of changes across environments, which would have prevented the second incident from occurring.",

          "body": "At 15:33 UTC on August 5, 2025, we initiated a production database migration to drop a column from a table backing pull request functionality. While the column was no longer in direct use, our ORM continued to reference the dropped column in a subset of pull request queries. As a result, there were elevated error rates across pushes, webhooks, notifications, and pull requests with impact peaking at approximately 4% of all web and REST API traffic. <br /><br />We mitigated the issue by deploying a change that instructed the ORM to ignore the removed column. Most affected services recovered by 16:13 UTC. However, that fix was applied only to our largest production environment. An update to some of our custom and canary environments did not pick up the fix and this triggered a secondary incident affecting ~0.1% of pull request traffic, which was fully resolved by 19:45 UTC.<br /><br />While migrations have protections such as progressive roll-out first targeting validation environments and acknowledge gates, this incident identified an application monitoring gap that would have prevented continued rollout when impact was observed. We will add additional automation and safeguards to prevent future incidents without requiring human intervention. We are also already working on a way to streamline some types of changes across environments, which would have prevented the second incident from occurring.",

On average, the error rate was .005%, with a peak error rate of 3.89%. This was due to a sustained increase in unauthenticated repository traffic.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by applying regional rate limiting, rolling back a service that was unable to scale with the additional traffic, and addressed a bug that impacted the caching of raw requests. Additionally, we horizontally scaled several dependencies of the service to appropriately handle the increase in traffic.<br /><br />We are working on improving our time to detection and have implemented controls to prevent similar incidents in future.",

On average, the error rate was .005%, with a peak error rate of 3.89%. This was due to a sustained increase in unauthenticated repository traffic.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by applying regional rate limiting, rolling back a service that was unable to scale with the additional traffic, and addressed a bug that impacted the caching of raw requests. Additionally, we horizontally scaled several dependencies of the service to appropriately handle the increase in traffic.<br /><br />We are working on improving our time to detection and have implemented controls to prevent similar incidents in future.",

This was due to resource provisioning failures in one of our datacenter regions. During this period, approximately 2% of Ubuntu-24 hosted runner jobs on private repos were delayed. Other hosted runners, self-hosted runners, and public repo workflows were unaffected.<br /><br />To mitigate the issue, additional worker capacity was added from a different datacenter region at 15:35 UTC and further increased at 16:00 UTC. By 16:30 UTC, job queues were healthy and service was operating normally. Since the incident, we have deployed changes to improve how regional health is accounted for when allocating new runners, and we are investigating further improvements to our automated capacity scaling logic and manual overrides to prevent a recurrence.",

At the peak of this incident (a 2 minute period around 07:00 UTC) error rates peaked at 11% and went down shortly after. Average web request load times rose to 1 second during this same time frame. After this period, traffic gradually recovered but error rate and latency remained slightly elevated until the end of the incident.<br /><br />This incident was triggered by a kernel bug that caused a crash of some of our load balancers during a scheduled process after a kernel upgrade. In order to mitigate the incident, we halted the roll out of our upgrades, and rolled back the impacted instances. We are working to make sure the kernel version is fully removed from our fleet. As a precaution, we temporarily paused the scheduled process to prevent any unintended use in the affected kernel. We also tuned our alerting so we can more quickly detect and mitigate future instances where we experience a sudden drop in load-balancing capacity.",

The incident was caused by imbalanced load in our underlying service infrastructure. The issue was mitigated by scaling up our services and tuning resource thresholds. We are working to improve our resilience to load spikes, capacity planning to prevent similar issues, and are implementing more robust monitoring to reduce detection and mitigation time for similar incidents in the future.",

Approximately 57% of codespaces were affected during this incident, during which some customers may have observed incomplete or delayed billing usage information in their dashboards and usage reports, and may not have received timely notifications about approaching usage or spending limits. <br /><br />The incident was caused by an increase in the number of jobs in our worker pool without a corresponding increase in capacity, resulting in a backlog of unprocessed Codespaces billing jobs. <br /><br />We mitigated the issue by scaling up worker capacity, allowing the backlog to clear and billing data to catch up. We started seeing recovery immediately at 17:40 UTC and were fully caught up by 19:04 UTC.<br /><br />To prevent recurrence, we are moving critical billing jobs into a dedicated worker pool monitored by the Codespaces team, and are reviewing alerting thresholds to ensure more rapid detection and mitigation of delays in the future.",

The clients of the service were not implemented to automatically handle an extra partition. Hence it was unable to retrieve data across partitions, resulting in unexpected 404 errors.\n\nAs a result, approximately 17% of coding sessions displayed an incorrect final state - such as sessions appearing in-progress when they were actually completed. Additionally, some Copilot-authored pull requests were missing timeline events indicating task completion. Importantly, this did not affect Copilot Coding Agent’s ability to finish code tasks and submit pull requests.\n\nTo prevent similar issues in the future we are taking steps to improve our systems and monitoring.",

          "body": "On June 5th, 2025, between 17:47 UTC and 19:20 UTC the Actions service was degraded, leading to run start delays and intermittent job failures. During this period, 47.2% of runs had delayed starts, and 21.0% of runs failed. The impact extended beyond Actions itself - 60% of Copilot Coding Agent sessions were cancelled, and all Pages sites using branch-based builds failed to deploy (though Pages serving remained unaffected). The issue was caused by a spike in load between internal Actions services exposing a misconfiguration that caused throttling of requests in the critical path of run starts. We mitigated the incident by correcting the service configuration to prevent throttling and have updated our deployment process to ensure the correct configuration is preserved moving forward.",

These were degraded at times, but peaked at 100% failure rates for some operations during this time.<br /><br />On May 23, a new feature was added to Copilot APIs and monitored during rollout but it was not tested at peak load. At 6:20 UTC on May 26, load increased on the code path in question and started to degrade a Copilot API because the caching for this endpoint and circuit breakers for high load were misconfigured.<br /><br />In addition, the traffic limiting meant to protect wider swaths of the GitHub API from queuing was not yet covering this endpoint, meaning it was able to overwhelm the capacity to serve traffic and cause request queuing.<br /><br />We were able to mitigate the incident by turning off the endpoint until the behavior could be reverted.<br /><br />We are already working on a quality of service strategy for API endpoints like this that will limit the impact of a broad incident and are rolling it out. We are also addressing the specific caching and circuit breaker misconfigurations for this endpoint, which would have reduced the time to mitigate this particular incident and the blast radius.",

On average, the error rate was 61% and peaked at 88% of requests to the service. This was due to the introduction of an uncaught fatal error in an internal service. A manual rollback was required which increased the time to remediate the incident.<br /><br />We are working to automatically detect and revert a change based on alerting to reduce our time to detection and mitigation.
