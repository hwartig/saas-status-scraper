Approximately 1.5% of jobs on larger and standard hosted runners in the West US region were impacted, 0.28% of all Actions jobs during this period.<br /><br />By 17:11 UTC, all traffic was routed away from the affected edge site, mitigating the timeouts.

Impacted users saw the error message: “Copilot encountered an error and was unable to review this pull request. You can try again by re-requesting a review.” The remaining requests completed successfully.<br /><br />The degradation was caused by elevated response times in an internal, model-backed dependency, which led to request timeouts and backpressure in the review processing pipeline, resulting in sustained queue growth and failed review completion.<br /><br />We mitigated the issue by temporarily bypassing fix suggestions to reduce latency, increasing worker capacity to drain the backlog, and rolling out a model configuration change that reduced end-to-end latency. Queue depth and request success rates returned to normal and remained stable through peak traffic.<br /><br />Following the incident, we increased baseline worker capacity, added instrumentation for worker utilization and queue health, and are improving automatic load-shedding, fallback behavior, and alerting to reduce time to detection and mitigation for similar issues.",

We mitigated this by deleting the runner.<br /><br />The routing configuration is not something controlled externally. A manual override was done previously for internal testing, but left incorrect metadata for a large runner instance. An infrastructure migration caused this misconfigured runner to come online which started the incorrect assignments. We are removing the ability to manually override this configuration entirely, and are adding alerting to identify possible OS mismatches for hosted runner jobs.<br /><br />As a reminder, hosted runner VMs are secure and ephemeral, with every VM reimaged after every single job. All jobs impacted here were originally targeted at a GitHub-owned VM image and were run on a GitHub-owned VM image.",

All jobs successfully completed despite the delays. At peak impact, approximately 8% of workflow runs were affected.<br /><br />During this incident, some nodes received a spike in workflow events that led to queuing of event processing. Because runs are pinned to nodes, runs being processed by these nodes saw delays in starting or showing as completed. The team was alerted to this at 8:58 UTC. Impacted nodes were disabled from processing new jobs to allow queues to drain.<br /><br />We have increased overall processing capacity and are implementing safeguards to better balance load across all nodes when spikes occur. This is important to ensure our available capacity can always be fully utilized.",

The incident was triggered by a buildup of synchronization requests, resulting in elevated Redis key usage and high CPU consumption on the underlying Redis cluster.<br /><br />To mitigate further impact, we proactively paused all team synchronization requests between 3:00 pm UTC and 8:15 pm UTC, allowing us to stabilize the Redis cluster. Our engineering team also resolved the issue by flushing the affected Redis keys and queues, which promptly stopped runaway growth and restored service health. Additionally, we scaled up our infrastructure resources to improve our ability to process the high volume of synchronization requests. All pending team synchronizations were successfully processed following service restoration.<br /><br />We are working to strengthen the Team Synchronization service by implementing a killswitch, adding throttling to prevent excessive enqueueing of synchronization requests, and improving the scheduler to avoid duplicate job requests. Additionally, we’re investing in better observability to alert when job drops occur. These efforts are focused on preventing similar incidents and improving overall reliability going forward.",

Users were able to downgrade to the 1.18.0 version of the extension during this period to work around this issue. At peak, the error rate was 19% of connection requests. This was caused by mismatching version dependencies for the released VS Code Codespaces extension.<br /><br />The connection issues were mitigated by releasing the VS Code Codespaces extension version 1.18.2 that addressed the issue. Users utilizing version 1.18.1 of the VS Code Codespaces extension are advised to upgrade to version >=1.18.2.<br /><br />We are improving our validation and release process for this extension to ensure functional issues like this are caught before release to customers and to reduce detection and mitigation times for extension issues like this in the future.",

          "body": "On November 19, between 17:36 UTC and 18:04 UTC, GitHub Actions service experienced degraded performance that caused excessive latency in queueing and updating workflow runs and job statuses. Operations related to artifacts, cache, job steps and logs also had significantly increased latency. At peak, 67% of workflow jobs queued during that timeframe were impacted, and the median latency for impacted operations increased by up to 35x.<br /><br />This was caused by a significant change in load pattern on Actions Cache-related operations, leading to a saturated shared resource on the backend. The impact was mitigated by mitigating the new load pattern.<br /><br />To reduce the likelihood of a recurrence, we are improving rate-limiting measures in this area to ensure a more consistent experience for all customers.  We are also evaluating changes to reduce the scope of impact.",

These failures also impacted products that rely on Git operations.<br /><br />The root cause was an expired TLS certificate used for internal service-to-service communication. We mitigated the incident by replacing the expired certificate and restarting impacted services. Once those services were restarted we saw a full recovery.<br /><br />We have updated our alerting to cover the expired certificate and are performing an audit of other certificates in this area to ensure they also have the proper alerting and automation before expiration. In parallel, we are accelerating efforts to eliminate our remaining manually managed certificates, ensuring all service-to-service communication is fully automated and aligned with modern security practices.",

A change to the notifications settings access path introduced additional load to the settings system, degrading its response times. This impacted both requests to web notifications (with p99 response times as high as 1.5s, while lower percentiles remained stable) and notification deliveries, which reached a peak delay of 24 minutes on average. System capacity was increased around 15:10 UTC and the problematic change was fully reverted soon after that, restoring the latency of web notifications and increasing notification delivery throughput, decreasing the delay in notification deliveries. The notification queue was fully emptied around 17:40 UTC.<br /><br />We are working to adjust capacity in the affected systems and to improve the time needed to address these capacity issues.",

This impacted all customers queueing workflows from the UI for most of the impact window. The issue was caused by a faulty code change in the UI, which was promptly reverted once the impact was identified. Detection was delayed due to an alerting gap for UI breaks in this area when all underlying APIs are still healthy. We are implementing enhanced alerting and additional automated tests to prevent similar regressions and reduce detection time in the future.",

There were approximately 100 requests during the incident that would have failed the download. Recovery began around 20:25 UTC.<br /><br />We were able to apply a number of mitigations to reduce impact over the course of the incident, but we did not achieve 100% recovery until our service provider’s incident was resolved.<br /><br />We are working to reduce critical path dependencies on the service provider and gracefully degrade experiences where possible so that we are more resilient to future dependency outages.",

The impact was limited to logged in users accessing repositories in organizations with more than 200,000 members. Forks of repositories from affected large organizations were also impacted. Git operations were functional throughout this period.<br /><br />This was caused by feature flagged changes impacting organization membership. The changes caused unintended timeouts for organization membership count evaluations which led to repository landing pages not loading.<br /><br />The flag was turned off and a fix addressing the timeouts was deployed, including additional optimizations to better support organizations of this size.

Customers may have been unable to successfully authenticate into their GitHub Organizations during this period. Organization SAML recorded a maximum of 0.4% of SSO requests failing during this timeframe.<br /><br />This incident stemmed from a failure in a read replica database partition responsible for storing license usage information for GitHub Enterprise Cloud Organizations. This partition failure resulted in users from affected organizations, whose license usage information was stored on this partition, being unable to access SSO during the aforementioned window. A successful SSO requires an available license for the user who is accessing a GitHub Enterprise Cloud Organization backed by SSO.<br />The failing partition was subsequently taken out of service, thereby mitigating the issue. <br /><br />Remedial actions are currently underway to ensure that a read replica failure does not compromise the overall service availability.<br />",

During this time, 2.11% workflow runs failed to start within 5 minutes, with an average delay of 8.2 minutes. The root cause was increased latency on a node in one of our Redis clusters, triggered by resource contention after a patching event became stuck. <br /><br />Recovery began once the patching process was unstuck and normal connectivity to the Redis cluster was restored at 11:45 UTC, but it took until 12:20 UTC to clear the backlog of queued work. We are implementing safeguards to prevent this failure mode and enhancing our monitoring to detect and address problems like this more quickly in the future.",

On average, the error rate for codespace creation was 39.5% and peaked at 71% of requests to the service during the incident window. Resume operations averaged 23.4% error rate with a peak of 46%. This was due to a cascading failure triggered by an outage in a 3rd-party dependency required to build devcontainer images.<br /><br />The impact was mitigated when the 3rd-party dependency recovered.<br /><br />We are investigating opportunities to make this dependency not a critical path for our container build process and working to improve our monitoring and alerting systems to reduce our time to detection of issues like this one in the future.",

When the feature was partially rolled out it performed an excessive number of writes per request which caused excessive latency for writes from other API and Web endpoints and resulted in 5xx errors to customers. <br /><br />The issue was identified by our automatic alerting and reverted by turning down the percentage of traffic to the new feature, which led to recovery of the data cluster and services. <br /><br />We are working to improve the way we roll out new features like this and move the specific writes from this incident to a storage solution more suited to this type of activity. We have also optimized this particular feature to avoid its rollout from having future impact on other areas of the site. We are also investigating how we can even more quickly identify issues like this.",
