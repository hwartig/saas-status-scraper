During the incident, approximately 9% of pull requests (less than the 20% first reported) experienced staleness of up to 7m. The root cause was identified to be an increase in the latency of a downstream dependency causing pull request workers to saturate their available capacity, resulting in delayed updates to PRs - no data was lost during this incident.\n\t\nWe mitigated this by adding additional capacity to the affected worker pool at 15:02 UTC. This allowed our background jobs to catch up with the backlog of updates and provide relief to our customers.

          "body": "On October 5, 2023 at 13:40 UTC, our monitoring systems observed an increase in the time it was taking for Git pushes to become visible when viewing commits in Pull Requests. Under normal operating conditions, a series of asynchronous jobs runs in response to every push and within a few seconds applies a number of side-effects in Pull Requests such as requesting reviews, marking Pull Requests as merged, and showing new commits. During the incident, jobs were entering the queue faster than we could process them, resulting in processing delays as high as 75 seconds on average, and as much as 15 minutes in the worst case. About 10% of all Pull Request page loads were showing out-of-date data during this time.\n\nWe had recently created a dedicated worker pool for processing these side-effects, with the goal of improving isolation between services and providing product teams with more direct control over critical parts of the system. We mitigated the incident by increasing capacity of the worker pool, which fully processed the backlog of delayed jobs, and returned everything to normal by 16:07 UTC. In response to this incident, we have adjusted our monitoring thresholds and improved our procedures for scaling up worker pools in response to increasing utilization.",

During the incident, some customers experienced delays in starting Github Actions workflow runs and receiving status updates for in-progress runs. The root cause was identified to be a change that was deployed to an internal distributed event streaming platform which resulted in several worker nodes to go over a misconfigured memory limit. This caused these nodes to restart leading to a reduced job processing throughput. Github Actions relies on events delivered through this event streaming platform to start workflow runs and update their status. Delays in receiving these events led to run delays for about 40% of the Actions workflows.\n\t\nWe mitigated this through a rollback of the offending change at 00:18 UTC. This allowed our event streaming platform to catch up with the backlog of workflow runs that were queued during the incident. The backlog was processed by 00:44 UTC. We have additional repair items in place to prevent a recurrence in the future.",

We first resolved the data replication issue, which returned Git Operations, APIs, and Issues to normal operation. We then restored Projects data to its pre-migration state, and re-inserted data that was added during the period of partial availability. The incident was resolved on 2023-09-20 at 00:06 UTC.\n\nAs a result of this incident, we have improved validation of data migrations in test and during rollout.  We have also identified improvements to reduce both the time to restore and to fix the replication issue.",

SAML login was affected, as was access to Actions, Issues, Pull Requests, Pages, API, Webhooks, Codespaces, and Packages. In this case, our automatic failover was unable to handle the partial file system failure mode.

This capability is typically used for larger CI/CD systems and bulk download of repository data.  This also caused intermittent periods of Actions workflow failures.\n\nDuring this incident we saw bursts of increased unique traffic on specific endpoints that overloaded our caching capability for this system. In addition, the traffic caused saturation of the service that exposed a bug in downloading archived files at high load which caused some archives to be downloaded with incomplete data. This caused intermittent failure of workflows for GitHub Actions, which primarily downloads actions data via these endpoints.\n\nWe mitigated this through improvements to our rate limiting and changes to get to a healthy state across our backend service and cache . We initially relied on automated communication messages during this incident and will be working to ensure future incidents have more relevant status updates with specific customer impact.",
