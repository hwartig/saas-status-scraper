At 14:21 UTC on April 14th, community reports of this were confirmed and an incident declared. Emails most impacted by the delay were password reset and unrecognized device verification, which contain time-sensitive links or verification codes, and are required to be acted on in order for password resets or unrecognized logins to proceed. <br /><br />Users attempting to reset their password during the incident were unable to complete the reset. Users without two-factor authentication (2FA), signing in on an unrecognized device, were unable to complete device verification. Enterprise Managed Users, users with 2FA, and users on recognized devices or IP addresses were still able to sign in. This impacted 800-1000 user device verifications and 300-400 password resets. <br /><br />The mailer delays were caused by increased usage of a shared resource pool; a separate internal job queue became unhealthy and prevented the mailer queue from being worked on. <br /><br />We have made some immediate improvements to better detect and react to this type of situation again. As a short-term mitigation strategy, we have added a queue-bypass ability for  time-sensitive emails, like password reset and unrecognized device verification. We can enable this setting if we observe email delays reoccurring, which will ensure that future incidents do not affect user ability to complete critical login flows. We have paused the unhealthy job queue, to prevent impact to other queues using shared resources. And we have updated our methods of detection for anomalous email delivery, to identify this issue sooner.",

All Pages deployments failed for the duration of the incident. Git Systems saw approximately 12% of raw file download requests and 16% of repository archive download requests return HTTP 50X error codes for the duration of the incident. Issues experienced increased latency for issue creation and updates. Codespaces saw roughly 500 requests to create and resume a Codespace timeout during the incident.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by rolling back the offending query. We are working to introduce measures to automatically detect compute-intensive queries in test runs during CI to prevent an issue like this one from recurring.",

We mitigated the impact by failing the instance over to more capable hardware and shipping an improved version of the query that runs against read replicas. In response to this incident, we are also working to make performance improvements to the class of queries that most frequently resulted in failed requests during this timeframe.<br /><br />Web-based repository file editing saw a 17% failure rate during the incident with other repository management operations (e.g. rule updates, web-based branch creation, repository renames) seeing failure rates between 1.5% and 8%. API failure rates for these operations were higher.<br /><br />Issue and Pull Request authoring was heavily impacted during this incident due to reliance on the impacted database primary. We are continuing work to remove our dependence on this particular primary instance from our authoring workflows for these services.<br /><br />GitHub search saw a 5% failure rate throughout this incident due to reliance on the impacted primary database when authorizing repository access. The majority of failing requests were for search bar autocomplete with a limited number of search result failures as well.",

Additionally, 0.15% of Webhook deliveries were degraded due to an unrelated spike in database latency in a single availability zone. SLOs for Actions were 90% during the incident, but this was not evenly distributed across customers. We statused green after a long stretch of recovered SLOs, starting at April 4th, 2024 00:35 UTC. During this incident, we also had issues with incident tooling (https://www.githubstatus.com/) failing to update the public status page and occasionally not loading.<br /><br />The incident was resolved after the infrastructure issue was mitigated at 2024-04-04 04:27 UTC.<br /><br />We are working to improve monitoring and processes in response to this incident. We are investigating how we can improve resilience and our communication with our infrastructure provider, and how we can better handle ongoing incidents that are no longer impacting SLOs. We are also improving our incident tooling to ensure that the public status page is updated in a timely manner.",

          "body": "On March 15, 2024, between 19:42 UTC and 20:24 UTC several services were degraded due to a regression in calling the permissions system. <br /><br />New GitHub Codespaces could not be created, as were Codespaces sessions that required minting a new auth token.<br /><br />Actions saw delays and infrastructure failures due to the upstream dependency on fetching tokens for the repository for runs to successfully execute. <br /><br />GitHub Pages were affected due to the impact on Actions, resulting in 1266 page builds failing, which at the low point represented 33% of page builds failing. This resulted in page edits not being reflected on those impacted sites.<br /><br />We deployed an application update that included a newer version of our database query builder. The new version uses a newer MySQL syntax for upsert queries that is not supported by the database proxy service we use for some of our production-environment database clusters. This incompatibility impacted the permissions cluster specifically, causing requests that attempted such queries to fail.<br /><br />We responded by rolling back the deployment, restoring the previous query use, and thus mitigated the incident.<br /><br />We have identified and corrected a misconfiguration of the permissions cluster in our development and CI environments that will ensure queries utilize the proxy service to prevent future syntax additions causing issues in production.<br />",

          "body": "On March 11, 2024 starting at 22:45 UTC and ending on March 12, 2024 00:48 UTC various GitHub services were degraded and returned intermittent errors for users. During this incident, the following customer impacts occurred: API error rates as high as 1%, Copilot error rates as high as 17%, and Secret Scanning and 2FA using GitHub Mobile error rates as high as 100% followed by a drop in error rates to 30% starting at 22:55 UTC. This elevated error rate was due to a degradation of our centralized authentication service upon which many other services depend.<br /><br />The issue was caused by a deployment of network related configuration that was inadvertently applied to the incorrect environment. This error was detected within 4 minutes and a rollback was initiated. While error rates began dropping quickly at 22:55 UTC, the rollback failed in one of our data centers, leading to a longer recovery time. At this point, many failed requests succeeded upon retrying. This failure was due to an unrelated issue that had occurred earlier in the day where the datastore for our configuration service was polluted in a way that required manual intervention. The bad data in the configuration service caused the rollback in this one datacenter to fail. A manual removal of the incorrect data allowed the full rollback to complete at 00:48 UTC thereby restoring full access to services. We understand how the corrupt data was deployed and continue to investigate why the specific data caused the subsequent deployments to fail.<br /><br />We are working on various measures to ensure safety of this kind of configuration change, faster detection of the problem via better monitoring of the related subsystems, and improvements to the robustness of our underlying configuration system including prevention and automatic cleanup of polluted records such that we can automatically recover from this kind of data issue in the future.<br />",

          "body": "On March 11, 2024 between at 18:44 UTC and 19:10 UTC, GitHub Actions performance was degraded and some users experienced errors when trying to queue workflows. Approximately 3.7% of runs queued during this time were unable to start.<br /><br />The issue was partially caused by a deployment of an internal system Actions relies on to process workflow run events. The pausing of the queue processing during this deployment for about 3 minutes caused a spike in queued workflow runs. When this queue began to be processed, the high number of queued workflows overwhelmed a secret-initialization component of the workflow invocation system. The errors generated by this overwhelmed system ultimately delayed workflow invocation. Through our alerting system, we received initial indications of an issue at approximately 18:44 UTC. However, we did not initially see impact on our run start delays and run queuing availability metrics until approximately 18:52 UTC. As the large queue of workflow run events burned down, we saw recovery in our key customer impact measures by 19:11 UTC, but waited to declare the incident resolved at 19:22 UTC while verifying there was no further customer impact.<br /><br />We are working on various measures to reduce spikes in queue build up during deployments of our queueing system, and have scaled up the workers which handle secret generation and storage during the workflow invocation process.<br />",

No data or jobs were lost.  From 14:17 to 14:41 UTC, there was a partial degradation, where customers would experience intermittent delays with PRs and Actions.  From 14:41 to 15:24 UTC, 36% of PRs users saw stale data, and 100% of in progress Actions workflows did not see updates , even though the workflows were succeeding.  At 15:24 UTC, we mitigated the incident by redeploying our service and jobs began to burn down, with full job catchup by 15:54 UTC. This was due to under provisioned memory and lack of memory based back pressure in the service, which overwhelmed consumers and led to OutOfMemory crashes.<br /><br />We have adjusted memory configurations to prevent this problem, and are analyzing and adjusting our alert sensitivity to reduce our time to detection of issues like this one in the future.<br />",

Nearly 95% of delays occurred between 11:05 and 11:27 UTC, with 5% during the remainder of the incident. During this incident, the following customer impacts occurred: 50% of webhooks experienced delays of up to 5m, 1% of webhooks experienced delays of 17m at peak; Actions: on average, 7% of customers experienced delays, with a peak of 44%; and many Issues saw a delay in appearing in searches. At 9:32 UTC our automated failover successfully routed traffic to a secondary cluster. But an improper restoration to primary at 10:32 UTC caused a significant increase in queued jobs until 11:21 UTC, when a correction was made and healthy services began burning down the backlog until full resolution.<br /><br />We have made improvements to the automation and reliability of our fallback process to prevent recurrence. We also have larger work already in progress to improve the overall reliability of our job processing platform.<br />",

At 16:15 UTC we made a configuration change to send traffic to regions that were not exhibiting the errors, which resulted in code completions working fully although completing at a higher latency than normal for some users. At 18:00 UTC we reverted the deploy and response durations returned to normal. <br /><br />We have added better monitoring to components that failed to decrease resolution times to incidents like this in the future.",

This change was deployed to a subset of our global edge sites.<br /><br />The change had the unintended consequence of causing IPv4 addresses to start being passed as an IPv4-mapped IPv6-compatible address to our IP Allow List functionality.<br /><br />For example 10.1.2.3 became ::ffff:10.1.2.3. While our IP Allow List functionality was developed with IPv6 in mind, it wasn't developed to handle these mapped addresses, and hence started blocking requests as it deemed these to be not in the defined list of allowed addresses. Request error rates peaked at 0.23% of all requests.<br /><br />We have so far identified three remediation items here:<br /><br />- Update the IP Allow List functionality to handle IPv4-mapped addresses.<br />- Audit the rest of our stack to confirm there are no further places this IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses flaw exists.<br />- Improve our testing and monitoring processes to better catch these issues in the future.",

The errors were initially limited to a single region and we were able to route around the issue by transparently failing over to other regions. However, errors gradually expanded across all regions we deploy to and led to our available compute capacity being exhausted.<br /><br />During the incident, up to 35% of Actions jobs using Larger Runners and 2% of Actions jobs using GitHub Hosted Runners overall may have experienced intermittent delays in starting. Once the issue was resolved by our cloud service provider, our systems made a full recovery without intervention.<br /><br />We’re working closely with our service provider to understand the cause of the outage and mitigations we can put in place. We’re also working to increase our resilience to outages of this nature by expanding the regions we deploy to beyond the existing set, especially for Larger Runners.",

This was caused by a combination of events that led to connection limits being hit in load balancer proxies in that site.  An upgrade of hosts was in flight, which meant a subset of proxy hosts were draining and coming offline as the upgrade rolled through the fleet.  A config change event also triggered a connection reset across all services in that site.  These events are commonplace, but led to a spike in connection establishment events that led to the online proxy hosts hitting the connection limit.  Upon further analysis, that limit was lower than it should have been.  We have increased that limit to prevent this from recurring.  We have also identified improvements to our monitoring of connection limits and behavior and changes to reduce the risk of proxy host upgrades leading to reduced capacity.",

After detecting the issue, we mitigated the impact by rolling back the change that caused the discrepancy in the cross origin rules. We have improved the way we are detecting issues like this one including implementing automated alerts during and after the rollout process so that we get signals as early as possible.",

Unfortunately, the outage prevented the generation of links for managing email subscriptions, resulting in the `/settings/emails` page timing out. Consequently, customers were unable to update their email subscription preferences during this period.<br /><br />During the incident we implemented graceful degradation on the `/settings/email` page to enable certain functionality, albeit with slower response times. By approximately 16:15 UTC on January 3rd, our contact permissions system was fully operational again, and customers could manage their email subscription preferences as usual.<br /><br />With the issue now resolved, our team is enhancing the `/settings/emails` page  resilience to minimize the impact of system outages in the future.

We fixed this vulnerability on GitHub.com the same day and began rotating all potentially exposed credentials. Through this process we found some flaws in how we rotate certain credentials and are working on improving our credential rotation process.

          "body": "On December 19, 2023, between 20:30 and 22:50 UTC multiple services experienced intermittent errors communicating with our MySQL backends. An average of 0.12% and max of 1.30% of requests hit 5xx errors and timeouts for web and API requests during this period. The majority of impact was mitigated at 22:10, with a lower rate of failures ending by 22:50. This issue was caused by unhandled exceptions during routine maintenance of our internal networking hosts. Hosts that were thought to be no longer serving traffic were removed from service which led to the initial errors. Recovery took longer than expected because of issues in our automated recovery tooling. As a result, manual intervention was performed to remove the unhealthy hosts and requests returned to normal. The bug in the automated recovery tooling has been fixed and we’ve made changes to prevent unintended removal of hosts that are serving traffic.",

During this time, approximately 2,500 users across 8,200 repos would have seen the merge button disabled or received failures from the merge API endpoint.\n\nUpon discovering the failures, our engineers assessed that the shortest path to resolution was to roll forward and manually deploy to the remaining hosts, which resolved the issue at 2023-12-18 21:26.",
