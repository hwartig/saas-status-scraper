Around 1% of enqueued PRs were affected, with around 7% of repositories that use a merge queue being impacted at some time during the incident.\n\nQueues were impacted if their target branch had the “require status checks” setting enabled, but did not have any individual required checks configured. Our monitoring strategy only covered PRs automatically removed from the queue, which was insufficient to detect this issue.\n\nWe are improving our monitors to cover anomalous manual queue entry removal rates, which will allow us to detect this class of issue much sooner.",

On average, Actions workflow run, job, and step updates were delayed as much as one hour. The delays were caused by updates in a dependent service that led to failures in Redis connectivity. Delays recovered once the Redis cluster connectivity was restored at 8:16 UTC. The incident was fully mitigated once the job queue had processed by 9:24 UTC. This incident followed an earlier short period of impact on hosted runners due to a similar issue, which was mitigated by failing over to a healthy cluster.<br /><br />From this, we are working to improve our observability across Redis clusters to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future where multiple clusters and services were impacted.  We will also be working to reduce the time to mitigate and improve general resilience to this dependency.",

          "body": "On October 11, 2024, starting at 05:59 UTC, DNS infrastructure in one of our sites started to fail to resolve lookups following a database migration. Attempts to recover the database led to cascading failures that impacted the DNS systems for that site. The team worked to restore the infrastructure and there was no customer impact until 17:31 UTC. <br /><br />During the incident, impact to the following services could be observed:<br /><br />- Copilot: Degradation in IDE code completions for 4% of active users during the incident from 17:31 UTC to 21:45 UTC.<br />- Actions: Workflow runs delay (25% of runs delayed by over 5 minutes) and errors (1%) between 20:28 UTC and 21:30 UTC. Errors while creating Artifact Attestations.<br />- Customer migrations: From 18:16 UTC to 23:12 UTC running migrations stopped and new ones were not able to start.<br />- Support: support.github.com was unavailable from 19:28 UTC to 22:14 UTC. <br />- Code search: 100% of queries failed between 2024-10-11 20:16 UTC and 2024-10-12 00:46 UTC.<br /><br />Starting at 18:05 UTC, engineering attempted to repoint the degraded site DNS to a different site to restore DNS functionality. At 18:26 UTC the test system had validated this approach and a progressive rollout to the affected hosts proceeded over the next hour. While this mitigation was effective at restoring connectivity within the site, it caused issues with connectivity from healthy sites back to the degraded site, and the team proceeded to plan out a different remediation effort.<br /><br />At 20:52 UTC, the team finalized a remediation plan and began the next phase of mitigation by deploying temporary DNS resolution capabilities to the degraded site. At 21:46 UTC, DNS resolution in the degraded site began to recover and was fully healthy at 22:16 UTC. Lingering issues with code search were resolved at 01:11 UTC on October 12.<br /><br />The team continued to restore the original functionality within the site after public service functionality was restored. GitHub is working to harden our resiliency and automation processes around this infrastructure to make diagnosing and resolving issues like this faster in the future.",

Additionally, there was no impact to customers in other regions.<br /><br />The cause was traced to storage capacity constraints in the region and was mitigated by temporarily redirecting create requests to other regions. Afterwards, additional storage capacity was added to the region and traffic was routed back. <br /><br />A bug was also identified that caused some available capacity to not be utilized, artificially constraining capacity and halting creations in the region prematurely. We have since fixed this bug as well, so that available capacity scales as expected according to our capacity planning projections.",

During this time Copilot chat requests failed at an average rate of 15%.<br /><br />This was due to a faulty deployment in a service provider that caused server errors from multiple regions. Traffic was routed away from those regions at 22:28 UTC and 23:39 UTC, which partially restored functionality, while the upstream service provider rolled back their change. The rollback was completed at 04:41 UTC.<br /><br />We are continuing to improve our ability to respond more quickly to similar issues through faster regional redirection and working with our upstream provider on improved monitoring.<br />",

Approximately 1,100 runs were delayed long enough to get marked as abandoned. The runs that weren't abandoned completed successfully after we recovered from the incident. Actions jobs experienced average delays of 23 minutes, with some jobs experiencing delays as high as 45 minutes. During the course of the incident, 17% of runs were delayed by more than 5 minutes. At peak, as many as 80% of runs experienced delays exceeding 5 minutes. The root cause was a misconfiguration in the service that manages runner connections, which caused CPU throttling and led to a performance degradation in that service.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by diverting runner connections away from the misconfigured nodes. We are working to improve our internal monitoring and alerting to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.",

The overall SSH error rate during this period was 0.0005%, with a peak error rate of 0.3%.\n\nThe root cause was traced to a regression in the service reload mechanism, which resulted in SSH hosts dropping connections on an hourly basis. As SSH hosts were rebooted for routine security updates, the issue progressively affected more hosts.\n\nTo mitigate the impact, we removed the affected hosts from production traffic. The SSH regression has since been identified and resolved, with all SSH hosts fully restored. Additionally, we have implemented new monitoring to alert us of any SSH connection refusals moving forward.",

At 05:24 UTC, we implemented a mitigation to shift traffic to healthy infrastructure and new Actions Runs resumed normal operations. During the rest of the incident window, Actions runs started before 05:24 UTC continued to see delays publishing logs or job results.  No Actions runs or Webhook deliveries were lost, only delayed.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by immediately shifting traffic to a healthy cluster while investigating. The incident was caused by an erroneous configuration change on our eventing platform. A permanent fix was deployed at 06:22 UTC after which services began to recover and burn down their backed up queues, with full recovery by 07:13 UTC.<br /><br />We are working to reduce our time to detection and develop test automation to prevent issues like this one in the future.<br />",

On average, 2.5% of workflow runs failed to start with the failure rate peaking at 6%. In addition we saw a 1% error rate for Actions API endpoints. This was due to an Actions service being deployed to faulty hardware that had an incorrect memory configuration, leading to significant performance degradation of those pods due to insufficient memory.<br /><br />The impact was mitigated when the pods were evicted automatically and moved to healthy hosts. The faulty hardware was disabled to prevent a recurrence. We are improving our health checks to ensure that unhealthy hardware is consistently marked offline automatically. We are also improving our monitoring and deployment practices to reduce our time to detection and automated mitigation at the service layer for issues like this in the future.",

On average, 10% of Actions workflow runs failed to start with the failure rate peaking at 15%. This was due to an infrastructure change that enabled a network proxy for requests between the Actions service and an internal API which caused requests to fail.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by rolling back the change. We are working to improve our monitoring and deployment practices to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.",

There was no data loss or corruption during this incident.<br /> <br />At 22:59 UTC an erroneous configuration change rolled out to all GitHub.com databases that impacted the ability of the database to respond to health check pings from the routing service. As a result, the routing service could not detect healthy databases to route application traffic to. This led to widespread impact on GitHub.com starting at 23:02 UTC.<br /> <br />We mitigated the incident by reverting the change and confirming restored connectivity to our databases. At 23:38 UTC, traffic resumed and all services recovered to full health. Out of an abundance of caution, we continued to monitor before resolving the incident at 00:30 UTC on August 15th, 2024.<br /> <br />To prevent recurrence we are implementing additional guardrails in our database change management process. We are also prioritizing several repair items such as faster rollback functionality and more resilience to dependency failures.<br /> <br />Given the severity of this incident, follow-up items are the highest priority work for teams at this time.",

This was due to a partial rollout of a caching layer for Copilot licensing checks. During the rollout, connections to the caching layer were overwhelmed causing the licensing checks to timeout. Many pages were impacted by this failure due to a lack of resiliency to the timeouts.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by reverting the rollout of the caching layer 11 minutes after initial detection. This immediately restored functionality for affected users.<br /><br />We are working to gracefully degrade experiences during these types of failures and reduce dependencies across services that may cause these types of failures in the future.<br />",

Runners without VNet Injection or those with VNet Injection in other regions were not affected. The issue was caused due to an outage in a third party provider blocking a large percentage of VM allocations in the East US 2 region. Once the underlying issue with the third party provider was resolved, job queue times went back to normal. We are exploring the addition of support for customers to define VNet Injection Runners with VNets across multiple regions to minimize the impact of outages in a single region.",

          "body": "Beginning on July 18, 2024 at 22:38 UTC, network issues within an upstream provider led to degraded experiences across Actions, Copilot, and Pages services.<br /><br />Up to 50% of Actions workflow jobs were stuck in the queuing state, including Pages deployments.  Users were also not able to enable Actions or register self-hosted runners. This was caused by an unreachable backend resource in the Central US region. That resource is configured for geo-replication, but the replication configuration prevented resiliency when one region was unavailable. Updating the replication configuration mitigated the impact by allowing successful requests while one region was unavailable. By July 19 00:12 UTC, users saw some improvement in Actions jobs and full recovery of Pages. Standard hosted runners and self-hosted Actions workflows were healthy by 2:10 UTC and large hosted runners fully recovered at 2:38.<br /><br />Copilot requests were also impacted with up to 2% of Copilot Chat requests and 0.5% of Copilot Completions requests resulting in errors. Chat requests were routed to other regions after 20 minutes while Completions requests took 45 minutes to reroute. <br /><br />We have identified improvements to detection to reduce the time to engage all impacted on-call teams and improvements to our replication configuration and failover workflows to be more resilient to unhealthy dependencies and reduce our time to failover and mitigate customer impact.",

Further, we realized that the root cause of the timeouts was the <a href=\"https://status.githubapp.com/incidents/1886?viewTimeOption=UTC\">larger incident earlier in the day due to updating github’s network hardware</a>.<br />We realized this incident was already mitigated by the mitigation of the earlier incident.<br />We are working to see if we can improve our incident response process to better understand the connection between incidents in the future and avoid unnecessary incident noise for customers.<br />",

On average, the error rate was 0.3% for requests to github.com and the API, and 3.0% of requests for Packages. This incident was triggered by two unrelated events:<br /><br />- A planned testing event of an internal feature caused heavy loads on our databases, disrupting services across GitHub.<br />- A network configuration change deployed to support capacity expansion in a GitHub data center. <br /><br />We partially resolved the incident by aborting the testing event at 16:17 UTC and fully resolved the incident by rolling back the network configuration changes at 16:49 UTC. <br /><br />We have paused all planned capacity expansion activity within GitHub data centers until we have stabilized the root cause of this incident. In addition, we are reexamining our load testing practices so they can be done in a safer environment and making architectural changes to the feature that caused issues.<br />",

Between 01:00 and 02:00 UTC we were able to reroute traffic for Chat to bring error rates below 6%. During the time of impact customers would have seen delayed responses, errors, or timeouts during requests. GitHub code scanning autofix jobs were also delayed during this incident. <br /><br />A resource cleanup job was scheduled by <a href=\"https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status/history?trackingid=4L44-3F0\">Azure OpenAI (AOAI) service early July 13th</a> targeting a resource group thought to only contain unused resources. This resource group unintentionally contained critical, still in use, resources that were then removed. The cleanup job was halted before removing all resources in the resource group. Enough resources remained that GitHub was able to mitigate while resources were reconstructed.<br /><br />We are working with AOAI to ensure mitigation is in place to prevent future impact. In addition, we will improve traffic rerouting processes to reduce time to mitigate in the future.",

          "body": "On July 5, 2024, between 16:31 UTC and 18:08 UTC, the Webhooks service was degraded, with customer impact of delays to all webhook delivery. On average, delivery delays were 24 minutes, with a maximum of 71 minutes. This was caused by a configuration change to the Webhooks service, which led to unauthenticated requests sent to the background job cluster. The configuration error was repaired and re-deploying the service solved the issue. However, this created a thundering herd effect which overloaded the background job queue cluster which put its API layer at max capacity, resulting in timeouts for other job clients, which presented as increased latency for API calls.<br /><br />Shortly after resolving the authentication misconfiguration, we had a separate issue in the background job processing service where health probes were failing, leading to reduced capacity in the background job API layer which magnified the effects of the thundering herd. From 18:21 UTC to 21:14 UTC, Actions runs on PRs experienced approximately 2 minutes delay and maximum of 12 minutes delay. A deployment of the background job processing service remediated the issue.<br /><br />To reduce our time to detection, we have streamlined our dashboards and added alerting for this specific runtime behavior. Additionally, we are working to reduce the blast radius of background job incidents through better workload isolation.<br />",

          "body": "On June 28th, 2024, at 16:06 UTC, a backend update by GitHub triggered a significant number of long-running Organization membership update jobs in our job processing system. The job queue depth rose as these update jobs consumed most of our job worker capacity. This resulted in delays for other jobs across services such as Pull Requests and PR-related Actions workflows. We mitigated the impact to Pull Requests and Actions at 19:32 UTC by pausing all Organization membership update jobs. We deployed a code change at 22:30 UTC to skip over the jobs queued by the backend change and re-enabled Organization membership update jobs. We restored the Organization membership update functionality at 22:52 UTC, including all membership changes queued during the incident.<br /><br />During the incident, about 15% of Action workflow runs experienced a delay of more than five minutes. In addition, Pull Requests had delays in determining merge eligibility and starting associated Action workflows for the duration of the incident. Organization membership updates saw delays for upwards of five hours.<br /><br />To prevent a similar event in the future from impacting our users, we are working to: improve our job management system to better manage our job worker capacity; add more precise monitoring for job delays; and strengthen our testing practices to prevent future recurrences.",
