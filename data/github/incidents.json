          "body": "On May 28, 2025, from approximately 09:45 UTC to 14:45 UTC, GitHub Actions experienced delayed job starts for workflows in public repos using Ubuntu-24 standard hosted runners. This was caused by a misconfiguration in backend caching behavior after a failover, which led to duplicate job assignments and reduced available capacity. Approximately 19.7% of Ubuntu-24 hosted runner jobs on public repos were delayed.  Other hosted runners, self-hosted runners, and private repo workflows were unaffected.<br /><br />By 12:45 UTC, we mitigated the issue by redeploying backend components to reset state and scaling up available resources to more quickly work through the backlog of queued jobs. We are working to improve our deployment and failover resiliency and validation to reduce the likelihood of similar issues in the future.",

During the incident, 6% of all workflow runs couldn’t upload or download cache entries from the service, resulting in a non-blocking warning message in the logs and performance degradation. The disruption was caused by an infrastructure update related to the retirement of a legacy service, which unintentionally impacted Cache service availability.

These were degraded at times, but peaked at 100% failure rates for some operations during this time.<br /><br />On May 23, a new feature was added to Copilot APIs and monitored during rollout but it was not tested at peak load. At 6:20 UTC on May 26, load increased on the code path in question and started to degrade a Copilot API because the caching for this endpoint and circuit breakers for high load were misconfigured.<br /><br />In addition, the traffic limiting meant to protect wider swaths of the GitHub API from queuing was not yet covering this endpoint, meaning it was able to overwhelm the capacity to serve traffic and cause request queuing.<br /><br />We were able to mitigate the incident by turning off the endpoint until the behavior could be reverted.<br /><br />We are already working on a quality of service strategy for API endpoints like this that will limit the impact of a broad incident and are rolling it out. We are also addressing the specific caching and circuit breaker misconfigurations for this endpoint, which would have reduced the time to mitigate this particular incident and the blast radius.",

During this period, the success rate for Claude Sonnet 3.7 requests was highly variable, down to approximately 94% during the most severe spikes. Other models remained available and working as expected throughout the incident.<br />The issue was caused by capacity constraints in our model processing infrastructure that affected our ability to handle the large volume of Claude Sonnet 3.7 requests.<br />We mitigated the incident by rebalancing traffic across our infrastructure, adjusting rate limits, and working with our infrastructure teams to resolve the underlying capacity issues.

Customers may have seen extended wait times for migrations to start or complete.<br /><br />This incident was initially observed as a slowdown in migration processing. During our investigation, we identified that a recent change aimed at improving API query performance caused an increase in load signals, which triggered migration throttling. As a result, the performance of migrations was negatively impacted, and overall migration duration increased. In parallel, we identified a race condition that caused a specific migration to be repeatedly re-queued, further straining system resources and contributing to a backlog of migration jobs, resulting in accumulated delays. No data was lost, and all migrations were ultimately processed successfully.<br /><br />We have reverted the feature flag associated with a query change and are working to improve system safeguards to help prevent similar race condition issues from occurring in the future.",

On average, the error rate was 1.4% with a peak error rate of 2.24%. This was due to a configuration change which unexpectedly led a critical service to shut down on a subset of hosts that store repository data.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by re-deploying the affected service to restore its functionality.<br /><br />In order to prevent similar incidents from happening again, we identified the cause that triggered this behavior and mitigated it for future deployments. Additionally, to reduce time to detection we will improve monitoring of the impacted service.",

Additionally, ~0.5% of customers may have seen slow pull request page loads and increased timeouts in the GraphQL API. <br /><br />The incident was caused by queueing in serving systems due to a change in traffic patterns, specifically scraping activity targeting our API. We have adjusted limits and added flow control to systems in response to the changing traffic patterns to improve our ability to prevent future large queueing issues. We’ve additionally updated rate limiting unauthenticated requests to reduce overall load, more details are here:  <br />https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-08-updated-rate-limits-for-unauthenticated-requests/",

At the time, 837 migrations across 57 organizations were affected. Impacted migrations would have shown the error message \"Git source migration failed. Error message: An error occurred. Please contact support for further assistance.\" in the migration logs and required a retry.<br /><br />The root cause of the issue was a recent configuration change that caused our workers, responsible for syncing the Git repository, to lose the necessary access required for the migration. We were able to retrieve the needed access for the workers , and all dependent services resumed normal operation.<br />We’ve identified and implemented additional safeguards to help prevent similar disruptions in the future.<br />",

The resulting error rates, which ranged from 2–5% of total requests, led to intermittent service disruption for users. The issue was triggered by heavy workloads on the database leading to connection saturation.\n\nThe incident mitigated when the database throttling activated which allowed the system to rebalance the connections. This restored the traffic flow to the database and restored service functionality.\n\nTo prevent similar issues in the future, we are reviewing the capacity of the database, improving monitoring and alerting systems, and implementing safeguards to reduce time to detection and mitigation.",

At peak, approximately 1–1.5% of users were affected by delays in synchronizing pull requests. During this period, users may have seen a \"Processing updates\" message in their pull requests after pushing new commits, and the new commits did not appear in the Pull Request view as expected. The Pull Request synchronization process has automatic retries and most delays were automatically resolved. Any Pull Requests that were not resynchronized during this window were manually synchronized on Friday, April 11 at 14:23 UTC.<br /><br />This was due to a misconfigured GeoIP lookup file that our routine GitHub operations depended on and led to background job processing to fail. <br /><br />We mitigated the incident by reverting to a known good version of the GeoIP lookup file on affected hosts.<br /><br /><br />We are working to enhance our CI testing and automation by validating GeoIP metadata to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.",

This resulted in an increase in queue depth due to retries on failures to perform those jobs causing delays for non-migration sourced jobs.<br /><br />We declared an incident once we confirmed that this issue was not isolated to the problematic migration and other repositories were also failing to process ref updates. <br /><br />We mitigated the issue by stopping the migration and short circuiting the remaining jobs. Additionally, we increased the worker pool of this job to reduce the time required to recover. <br /><br />As a result of this incident, we are revisiting our repository migration process and are working to isolate potentially problematic migration workloads from non-migration workloads. <br />",

During the incident, about 0.3% of all workflow runs queued during the time failed to start, about 0.67% of all workflow runs were delayed by an average of 10 minutes, and about 0.16% of all workflow runs ultimately ended with an infrastructure failure. This was due to a networking issue with an underlying service provider. At 00:15 UTC the service provider mitigated their issue, and service was restored immediately for Actions.

During the incident, about 0.6% of workflow runs failed to start, 0.8% of workflow runs were delayed by an average of one hour, and 0.1% of runs ultimately ended with an infrastructure failure. The issue stemmed from connectivity problems between the Actions services and certain nodes within one of our Redis clusters. The service began recovering once connectivity to the Redis cluster was restored at 13:41 UTC. These connectivity issues are typically not a concern because we can fail over to healthier replicas. However, due to an unrelated issue, there was a replication delay at the time of the incident, and failing over would have caused a greater impact on our customers. We are working on improving our resiliency and automation processes for this infrastructure to improve the speed of diagnosing and resolving similar issues in the future.",
