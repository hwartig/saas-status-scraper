The impact was limited to logged in users accessing repositories in organizations with more than 200,000 members. Forks of repositories from affected large organizations were also impacted. Git operations were functional throughout this period.<br /><br />This was caused by feature flagged changes impacting organization membership. The changes caused unintended timeouts for organization membership count evaluations which led to repository landing pages not loading.<br /><br />The flag was turned off and a fix addressing the timeouts was deployed, including additional optimizations to better support organizations of this size.

Organization SAML recorded a maximum of 0.4% of SSO requests failing during this timeframe.<br /><br />This incident stemmed from a failure in a read replica database partition responsible for storing license usage information for GitHub Enterprise Cloud Organizations. This partition failure resulted in users from affected organizations, whose license usage information was stored on this partition, being unable to access SSO during the aforementioned window. A successful SSO requires an available license for the user who is accessing a GitHub Enterprise Cloud Organization backed by SSO.<br />The failing partition was subsequently taken out of service, thereby mitigating the issue. <br /><br />Remedial actions are currently underway to ensure that a read replica failure does not compromise the overall service availability.<br />",

When the feature was partially rolled out it performed an excessive number of writes per request which caused excessive latency for writes from other API and Web endpoints and resulted in 5xx errors to customers. <br /><br />The issue was identified by our automatic alerting and reverted by turning down the percentage of traffic to the new feature, which led to recovery of the data cluster and services. <br /><br />We are working to improve the way we roll out new features like this and move the specific writes from this incident to a storage solution more suited to this type of activity.

XL and Intel runners recovered by 10:10 UTC, with the other types taking longer to recover.<br /><br />The degraded capacity was triggered by a scheduled event at 07:00 UTC that led to a permission failure on Mac runner hosts, blocking reimage operations.  The permission issue was resolved by 9:41 UTC, but the recovery of available runners took longer than expected due to a combination of backoff logic slowing backend operations and some hosts needing state resets.<br /><br />We deployed changes immediately following the incident to address the scheduled event and ensure that similar failures will not block critical operations in the future.

The issue was caused by a faulty configuration change that disrupted service to service communication in GitHub Actions. During this period, in-progress jobs were delayed and new jobs would not start due to a failure to acquire runners, and about 30% of all jobs failed. GitHub Pages users were unable to build or deploy their Pages during this period.<br /><br />The offending change was rolled back within 15 minutes of its deployment, after which Actions workflows and Pages deployments began to succeed. Actions customers continued to experience delays for about 15 minutes after the rollback was completed while services worked through the backlog of queued jobs. We are planning to implement additional rollout checks to help detect and prevent similar issues in the future.",

Codespace creations and resumes were failed over to another region at 15:01 UTC. While many of the impacted instances self-recovered after mitigation efforts, approximately 2,000 codespaces remained stuck in a \"shutting down\" state while the team evaluated possible methods to recover unpushed data from the latest active session of affected codespaces. Unfortunately, recovery of that data was not possible. We unblocked shutdown of those codespaces, with all instances either shut down or available by 8:26 UTC on September 19.<br /><br />The disconnects were triggered by an exhaustion of resources in the network relay infrastructure in that region, but the lack of self-recovery was caused by an unhandled error impacting the local agent, which led to an unclean shutdown.<br /><br />We are improving the resilience of the local agent to disconnect events to ensure shutdown of codespaces is always clean without data loss.  We have also addressed the exhausted resources in the network relay and will be investing in improved detection and resilience to reduce the impact of similar events in the future.",

As a result, approximately 25% of repositories were temporarily missing from search results.<br /><br />By 12:45 UTC on Saturday, September 14, most missing repositories were restored from an earlier search index snapshot, and repositories updated between the snapshot and the restoration were reindexed. This backfill was completed at 21:25 UTC.<br /><br />After these repairs, about 98.5% of repositories were once again searchable. We are performing a full reconciliation of the search index and customers can expect to see records being updated and content becoming searchable for all repos again between now and Sept 25.<br /><br />NOTE: Users who notice missing or outdated repositories in search results can force reindexing by starring or un-starring the repository. Other repository actions such as adding topics, or updating the repository description, will also result in reindexing. In general, changes to searchable artifacts in GitHub will also update their respective search index in near-real time.<br /><br />User impact has been mitigated with the exception of the 1.5% of repos that are missing from the search index. The change responsible for the search issue has been reverted, and full reconciliation of the search index is underway, expected to complete by September 23. We have added additional checks to our indexing model to ensure this failure does not happen again. We are also investigating faster repair alternatives.<br /><br />To avoid resource contention and possible further issues we are currently not repairing repositories or organizations individually at this time.

          "body": "On September 15th between 17:55 and 18:20 UTC, Copilot experienced degraded availability for all features. This was due a partial deployment of a feature flag to a global rate limiter. The flag triggered behavior that unintentionally rate limited all requests, resulting in 100% of them returning 403 errors. The issue was resolved by reverting the feature flag which resulted in immediate recovery.<br /><br />The root cause of the incident was from an undetected edge case in our rate limiting logic. The flag was meant to scale down rate limiting for a subset of users, but unintentionally put our rate limiting configuration into an invalid state.<br /><br />To prevent this from happening again, we have addressed the bug with our rate limiting. We are also adding additional monitors to detect anomalies in our traffic patterns, which will allow us to identify similar issues during future deployments. Furthermore, we are exploring ways to test our rate limit scaling in our internal environment to enhance our pre-production validation process.<br />",

Additionally, larger runner customers experienced run start delays for runner groups with private networking configured in the eastus2 region. This was due to an outage in an underlying compute service provider in eastus2. 1.06% of Ubuntu 24 jobs and 0.16% of Ubuntu 22 jobs failed during this period.

          "body": "On August 27, 2025 between 20:35 and 21:17 UTC, Copilot, Web and REST API traffic experienced degraded performance. Copilot saw an average of 36% of requests fail with a peak failure rate of 77%. Approximately 2% of all non-Copilot Web and REST API traffic requests failed.\n\nThis incident occurred after we initiated a production database migration to drop a column from a table backing copilot functionality. While the column was no longer in direct use, our ORM continued to reference the dropped column. This led to a large number of 5xx responses and was similar to the incident on August 5th. At 21:15 UTC, we applied a fix to the production schema and by 21:17 UTC, all services had fully recovered.\n\nWhile repairs were in progress to avoid this situation, they were not completed quickly enough to prevent a second incident. We have now implemented a temporary block for all drop column operations as an immediate solution while we add more safeguards to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. We are also implementing graceful degradation so that Copilot issues will not impact other features of our product.",

This was caused by connectivity issues in our East US region, which prevented runners from retrieving jobs and sending progress updates. As a result, capacity was significantly reduced, especially for busier configurations, leading to queuing and service interruptions. Approximately 8.05% of jobs on public standard Ubuntu24 runners and 3.4% of jobs on private standard Ubuntu24 runners did not start as expected.<br /><br />By 18:10 UTC, we had mitigated the issue by provisioning additional resources in the affected region and burning down the backlog of queued runner assignments. By the end of that day, we deployed changes to improve runner connectivity resilience and graceful degradation in similar situations.  We are also taking further steps to improve system resiliency by enhancing observability of network connection health with runners and improving load distribution and failover handling to help prevent similar issues in the future.",

When searching for pull requests, issues, and workflow runs, users would have seen some slow, empty or incomplete results. In some cases, pull requests failed to load.<br /><br />The incident was triggered by intermittent connectivity issues between our load balancers and search hosts. While retry logic initially masked these problems, retry queues eventually overwhelmed the load balancers, causing failure. The incident was mitigated at 14:33 UTC by throttling our search index pipeline. <br /><br />Our automated alerting and internal retries reduced the impact of this event significantly. As a result of this incident we believe we have identified a faster way to mitigate it in the future. We are also working on multiple solutions to resolve the underlying connectivity issues.<br />",

The incident was caused by an outage in a downstream dependency that led to failures in backend service connectivity in one region. At 03:59 UTC, we evacuated a majority of services in the impacted region, but some users may have seen ongoing impact until all services were fully evacuated at 06:14 UTC. We are working to improve monitoring and processes of failover to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.",

Users experienced inaccurate or incomplete results, failures to load certain pages (like Issues, Pull Requests, Projects, and Deployments), and broken components like Actions workflow and label filters.<br /><br />Most user impact occurred between 14:00 UTC and 15:30 UTC, when up to 75% of search queries failed, and updates to search results were delayed by up to 100 minutes. <br /><br />The incident was triggered by intermittent connectivity issues between our load balancers and search hosts. While retry logic initially masked these problems, retry queues eventually overwhelmed the load balancers, causing failure. The query failures were mitigated at 15:30 UTC after throttling our search indexing pipeline to reduce load and stabilize retries.  The connectivity failures were resolved at 17:14 UTC after the automated reboot of a search host, causing the rest of the system to recover.  <br /><br />We have improved internal monitors and playbooks, and tuned our search cluster load balancer to further mitigate the recurrence of this failure mode. We continue to invest in resolving the underlying connectivity issues.",

This change led to an unexpected spike in connection attempts to our datastore and saturated its connection backlog and resulted in intermittent failures to serve required UI content.

While the column was no longer in direct use, our ORM continued to reference the dropped column in a subset of pull request queries. As a result, there were elevated error rates across pushes, webhooks, notifications, and pull requests with impact peaking at approximately 4% of all web and REST API traffic. <br /><br />We mitigated the issue by deploying a change that instructed the ORM to ignore the removed column. Most affected services recovered by 16:13 UTC. However, that fix was applied only to our largest production environment. An update to some of our custom and canary environments did not pick up the fix and this triggered a secondary incident affecting ~0.1% of pull request traffic, which was fully resolved by 19:45 UTC.<br /><br />While migrations have protections such as progressive roll-out first targeting validation environments and acknowledge gates, this incident identified an application monitoring gap that would have prevented continued rollout when impact was observed. We will add additional automation and safeguards to prevent future incidents without requiring human intervention. We are also already working on a way to streamline some types of changes across environments, which would have prevented the second incident from occurring.",

          "body": "At 15:33 UTC on August 5, 2025, we initiated a production database migration to drop a column from a table backing pull request functionality. While the column was no longer in direct use, our ORM continued to reference the dropped column in a subset of pull request queries. As a result, there were elevated error rates across pushes, webhooks, notifications, and pull requests with impact peaking at approximately 4% of all web and REST API traffic. <br /><br />We mitigated the issue by deploying a change that instructed the ORM to ignore the removed column. Most affected services recovered by 16:13 UTC. However, that fix was applied only to our largest production environment. An update to some of our custom and canary environments did not pick up the fix and this triggered a secondary incident affecting ~0.1% of pull request traffic, which was fully resolved by 19:45 UTC.<br /><br />While migrations have protections such as progressive roll-out first targeting validation environments and acknowledge gates, this incident identified an application monitoring gap that would have prevented continued rollout when impact was observed. We will add additional automation and safeguards to prevent future incidents without requiring human intervention. We are also already working on a way to streamline some types of changes across environments, which would have prevented the second incident from occurring.",
