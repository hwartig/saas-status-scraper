During the incident, 17% of workflow runs experienced cache download failures, resulting in a warning message in the logs and performance degradation. The disruption was caused by a network issue in our database systems that led to a database replica getting out of sync with the primary. We mitigated the incident by routing cache download url requests to bypass the out-of-sync replica until it was fully restored.<br /><br />To prevent this class of incidents, we are developing capability in our database system to more robustly bypass out-of-sync replicas. We are also implementing improved monitoring to help us detect similar issues more quickly going forward.",

Approximately 57% of codespaces were affected during this incident, during which some customers may have observed incomplete or delayed billing usage information in their dashboards and usage reports, and may not have received timely notifications about approaching usage or spending limits. <br /><br />The incident was caused by an increase in the number of jobs in our worker pool without a corresponding increase in capacity, resulting in a backlog of unprocessed Codespaces billing jobs. <br /><br />We mitigated the issue by scaling up worker capacity, allowing the backlog to clear and billing data to catch up. We started seeing recovery immediately at 17:40 UTC and were fully caught up by 19:04 UTC.<br /><br />To prevent recurrence, we are moving critical billing jobs into a dedicated worker pool monitored by the Codespaces team, and are reviewing alerting thresholds to ensure more rapid detection and mitigation of delays in the future.",

Additionally, some Copilot-authored pull requests were missing timeline events indicating task completion. Importantly, this did not affect Copilot Coding Agent’s ability to finish code tasks and submit pull requests.\n\nTo prevent similar issues in the future we are taking steps to improve our systems and monitoring.",

          "body": "On June 5th, 2025, between 17:47 UTC and 19:20 UTC the Actions service was degraded, leading to run start delays and intermittent job failures. During this period, 47.2% of runs had delayed starts, and 21.0% of runs failed. The impact extended beyond Actions itself - 60% of Copilot Coding Agent sessions were cancelled, and all Pages sites using branch-based builds failed to deploy (though Pages serving remained unaffected). The issue was caused by a spike in load between internal Actions services exposing a misconfiguration that caused throttling of requests in the critical path of run starts. We mitigated the incident by correcting the service configuration to prevent throttling and have updated our deployment process to ensure the correct configuration is preserved moving forward.",

During the incident, 6% of all workflow runs couldn’t upload or download cache entries from the service, resulting in a non-blocking warning message in the logs and performance degradation. The disruption was caused by an infrastructure update related to the retirement of a legacy service, which unintentionally impacted Cache service availability. We resolved the incident by reverting the change and have since implemented a permanent fix to prevent recurrence.<br /><br />We are improving our configuration change processes by introducing additional end-to-end tests to cover the identified gaps, and implementing deployment pipeline improvements to reduce mitigation time for similar issues in the future.",

At 6:20 UTC on May 26, load increased on the code path in question and started to degrade a Copilot API because the caching for this endpoint and circuit breakers for high load were misconfigured.<br /><br />In addition, the traffic limiting meant to protect wider swaths of the GitHub API from queuing was not yet covering this endpoint, meaning it was able to overwhelm the capacity to serve traffic and cause request queuing.<br /><br />We were able to mitigate the incident by turning off the endpoint until the behavior could be reverted.<br /><br />We are already working on a quality of service strategy for API endpoints like this that will limit the impact of a broad incident and are rolling it out. We are also addressing the specific caching and circuit breaker misconfigurations for this endpoint, which would have reduced the time to mitigate this particular incident and the blast radius.",

During this period, the success rate for Claude Sonnet 3.7 requests was highly variable, down to approximately 94% during the most severe spikes. Other models remained available and working as expected throughout the incident.<br />The issue was caused by capacity constraints in our model processing infrastructure that affected our ability to handle the large volume of Claude Sonnet 3.7 requests.<br />We mitigated the incident by rebalancing traffic across our infrastructure, adjusting rate limits, and working with our infrastructure teams to resolve the underlying capacity issues.

Customers may have seen extended wait times for migrations to start or complete.<br /><br />This incident was initially observed as a slowdown in migration processing. During our investigation, we identified that a recent change aimed at improving API query performance caused an increase in load signals, which triggered migration throttling. As a result, the performance of migrations was negatively impacted, and overall migration duration increased. In parallel, we identified a race condition that caused a specific migration to be repeatedly re-queued, further straining system resources and contributing to a backlog of migration jobs, resulting in accumulated delays. No data was lost, and all migrations were ultimately processed successfully.<br /><br />We have reverted the feature flag associated with a query change and are working to improve system safeguards to help prevent similar race condition issues from occurring in the future.",

The resulting error rates, which ranged from 2–5% of total requests, led to intermittent service disruption for users. The issue was triggered by heavy workloads on the database leading to connection saturation.\n\nThe incident mitigated when the database throttling activated which allowed the system to rebalance the connections. This restored the traffic flow to the database and restored service functionality.\n\nTo prevent similar issues in the future, we are reviewing the capacity of the database, improving monitoring and alerting systems, and implementing safeguards to reduce time to detection and mitigation.",

During this period, users may have seen a \"Processing updates\" message in their pull requests after pushing new commits, and the new commits did not appear in the Pull Request view as expected. The Pull Request synchronization process has automatic retries and most delays were automatically resolved. Any Pull Requests that were not resynchronized during this window were manually synchronized on Friday, April 11 at 14:23 UTC.<br /><br />This was due to a misconfigured GeoIP lookup file that our routine GitHub operations depended on and led to background job processing to fail. <br /><br />We mitigated the incident by reverting to a known good version of the GeoIP lookup file on affected hosts.<br /><br /><br />We are working to enhance our CI testing and automation by validating GeoIP metadata to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.",

This resulted in an increase in job failures and  delays for non-migration sourced jobs.<br /><br />We declared an incident once we confirmed that this issue was not isolated to the migrating repository and other repositories were also failing to process ref updates.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by shifting the migration jobs to a different job queue. <br /><br />To avoid problems like this in the future, we are revisiting our repository migration process and are working to isolate potentially problematic migration workloads from non-migration workloads.",
