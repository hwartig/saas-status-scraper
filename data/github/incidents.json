Users were able to downgrade to the 1.18.0 version of the extension during this period to work around this issue. At peak, the error rate was 19% of connection requests. This was caused by mismatching version dependencies for the released VS Code Codespaces extension.<br /><br />The connection issues were mitigated by releasing the VS Code Codespaces extension version 1.18.2 that addressed the issue. Users utilizing version 1.18.1 of the VS Code Codespaces extension are advised to upgrade to version >=1.18.2.<br /><br />We are improving our validation and release process for this extension to ensure functional issues like this are caught before release to customers and to reduce detection and mitigation times for extension issues like this in the future.",

Operations related to artifacts, cache, job steps and logs also had significantly increased latency. At peak, 67% of workflow jobs queued during that timeframe were impacted, and the median latency for impacted operations increased by up to 35x.<br /><br />This was caused by a significant change in load pattern on Actions Cache-related operations, leading to a saturated shared resource on the backend. The impact was mitigated by mitigating the new load pattern.<br /><br />To reduce the likelihood of a recurrence, we are improving rate-limiting measures in this area to ensure a more consistent experience for all customers.  We are also evaluating changes to reduce the scope of impact.",

A change to the notifications settings access path introduced additional load to the settings system, degrading its response times. This impacted both requests to web notifications (with p99 response times as high as 1.5s, while lower percentiles remained stable) and notification deliveries, which reached a peak delay of 24 minutes on average. System capacity was increased around 15:10 UTC and the problematic change was fully reverted soon after that, restoring the latency of web notifications and increasing notification delivery throughput, decreasing the delay in notification deliveries. The notification queue was fully emptied around 17:40 UTC.<br /><br />We are working to adjust capacity in the affected systems and to improve the time needed to address these capacity issues.",

This impacted all customers queueing workflows from the UI for most of the impact window. The issue was caused by a faulty code change in the UI, which was promptly reverted once the impact was identified. Detection was delayed due to an alerting gap for UI breaks in this area when all underlying APIs are still healthy. We are implementing enhanced alerting and additional automated tests to prevent similar regressions and reduce detection time in the future.",

On average the Codespace connection error rate was 90% and peaked at 100% across all regions throughout the incident period.<br />- GitHub Actions larger hosted runners experienced degraded performance, with 0.5% of overall workflow runs and 9.8% of larger hosted runner jobs failing or not starting within 5 minutes.

There were approximately 100 requests during the incident that would have failed the download. Recovery began around 20:25 UTC.<br /><br />We were able to apply a number of mitigations to reduce impact over the course of the incident, but we did not achieve 100% recovery until our service provider’s incident was resolved.<br /><br />We are working to reduce critical path dependencies on the service provider and gracefully degrade experiences where possible so that we are more resilient to future dependency outages.",

The impact was limited to logged in users accessing repositories in organizations with more than 200,000 members. Forks of repositories from affected large organizations were also impacted. Git operations were functional throughout this period.<br /><br />This was caused by feature flagged changes impacting organization membership. The changes caused unintended timeouts for organization membership count evaluations which led to repository landing pages not loading.<br /><br />The flag was turned off and a fix addressing the timeouts was deployed, including additional optimizations to better support organizations of this size.

Customers may have been unable to successfully authenticate into their GitHub Organizations during this period. Organization SAML recorded a maximum of 0.4% of SSO requests failing during this timeframe.<br /><br />This incident stemmed from a failure in a read replica database partition responsible for storing license usage information for GitHub Enterprise Cloud Organizations. This partition failure resulted in users from affected organizations, whose license usage information was stored on this partition, being unable to access SSO during the aforementioned window. A successful SSO requires an available license for the user who is accessing a GitHub Enterprise Cloud Organization backed by SSO.<br />The failing partition was subsequently taken out of service, thereby mitigating the issue. <br /><br />Remedial actions are currently underway to ensure that a read replica failure does not compromise the overall service availability.<br />",

This was due to a cascading failure triggered by an outage in a 3rd-party dependency required to build devcontainer images.<br /><br />The impact was mitigated when the 3rd-party dependency recovered.<br /><br />We are investigating opportunities to make this dependency not a critical path for our container build process and working to improve our monitoring and alerting systems to reduce our time to detection of issues like this one in the future.",

When the feature was partially rolled out it performed an excessive number of writes per request which caused excessive latency for writes from other API and Web endpoints and resulted in 5xx errors to customers. <br /><br />The issue was identified by our automatic alerting and reverted by turning down the percentage of traffic to the new feature, which led to recovery of the data cluster and services. <br /><br />We are working to improve the way we roll out new features like this and move the specific writes from this incident to a storage solution more suited to this type of activity. We have also optimized this particular feature to avoid its rollout from having future impact on other areas of the site. We are also investigating how we can even more quickly identify issues like this.",

On average, the error rate was 46% and peaked at 96% of requests to the service. XL and Intel runners recovered by 10:10 UTC, with the other types taking longer to recover.<br /><br />The degraded capacity was triggered by a scheduled event at 07:00 UTC that led to a permission failure on Mac runner hosts, blocking reimage operations.  The permission issue was resolved by 9:41 UTC, but the recovery of available runners took longer than expected due to a combination of backoff logic slowing backend operations and some hosts needing state resets.<br /><br />We deployed changes immediately following the incident to address the scheduled event and ensure that similar failures will not block critical operations in the future. We are also working to reduce the end-to-end time for self-healing of offline hosts for quicker full recovery of future capacity or host events.",

Codespace creations and resumes were failed over to another region at 15:01 UTC. While many of the impacted instances self-recovered after mitigation efforts, approximately 2,000 codespaces remained stuck in a \"shutting down\" state while the team evaluated possible methods to recover unpushed data from the latest active session of affected codespaces. Unfortunately, recovery of that data was not possible. We unblocked shutdown of those codespaces, with all instances either shut down or available by 8:26 UTC on September 19.<br /><br />The disconnects were triggered by an exhaustion of resources in the network relay infrastructure in that region, but the lack of self-recovery was caused by an unhandled error impacting the local agent, which led to an unclean shutdown.<br /><br />We are improving the resilience of the local agent to disconnect events to ensure shutdown of codespaces is always clean without data loss.  We have also addressed the exhausted resources in the network relay and will be investing in improved detection and resilience to reduce the impact of similar events in the future.",

On average, the error rate for these endpoints was less than 50% and peaked at 100% for about 26 hours over September 16th. API requests to the impacted endpoints were rejected with a 401 error code. This was due to a mismatch in authentication policies, for specific endpoints, during a system migration.<br /><br />The failure to detect the errors was the result of the issue occurring for a low percentage of traffic.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by reverting the policy in question, and correcting the logic associated with the degraded endpoints.

          "body": "Between 16:26 UTC on September 15th and 18:30 UTC on September 16th, anonymous REST API calls to approximately 20 endpoints were incorrectly rejected because they were not authenticated. While this caused unauthenticated requests to be rejected by these endpoints, all authenticated requests were unaffected, and no protected endpoints were exposed.<br /><br />This resulted in 100% of requests to these endpoints failing at peak, representing less than 0.1% of GitHub’s overall request volume. On average, the error rate for these endpoints was less than 50% and peaked at 100% for about 26 hours over September 16th. API requests to the impacted endpoints were rejected with a 401 error code. This was due to a mismatch in authentication policies, for specific endpoints, during a system migration.<br /><br />The failure to detect the errors was the result of the issue occurring for a low percentage of traffic.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by reverting the policy in question, and correcting the logic associated with the degraded endpoints. We are working to improve our test suite to further validate mismatches, and refining our monitors for proactive detection.",
