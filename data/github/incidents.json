During this window, Webhook deliveries for push events were delayed by up to 40 minutes, with an average delay of 10 minutes. GitHub Actions workflows triggered by push events experienced similar job start delays. Additionally, between 15:25 UTC and 16:05 UTC, all GitHub Actions workflow runs experienced status update delays of up to 11 minutes, with a median delay of 6 minutes.<br /><br />The issue stemmed from connection churn in our eventing service, which caused CPU saturation and delays for reads and writes, with subsequent downstream delivery delays for Actions and Webhooks. We have added observability tooling and metrics to accelerate detection, and are correcting stream processing client configuration to prevent recurrence.",

During this time, Actions jobs queued and timed out while waiting to acquire a hosted runner. Other GitHub features that leverage this compute infrastructure were similarly impacted, including Copilot Coding Agent, Copilot Code Review, CodeQL, Dependabot, GitHub Enterprise Importer, and Pages. All regions and runner types were impacted. Self-hosted runners on other providers were not impacted. <br /><br />This outage was caused by a backend storage access policy change in our underlying compute provider that blocked access to critical VM metadata, causing all VM create, delete, reimage, and other operations to fail. More information is available at https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status/history/?trackingId=FNJ8-VQZ. This was mitigated by rolling back the policy change, which started at 22:15 UTC.  As VMs came back online, our runners worked through the backlog of requests that hadn’t timed out. <br /><br />We are working with our compute provider to improve our incident response and engagement time, improve early detection before they impact our customers, and ensure safe rollout should similar changes occur in the future. We recognize this was a significant outage to our users that rely on GitHub’s workloads and apologize for the impact this had.",

During this time, Codespaces creation and resume operations failed in all regions. <br /><br />This outage was caused by a backend storage access policy change in our underlying compute provider that blocked access to critical VM metadata, causing all VM create, delete, reimage, and other operations to fail. More information is available at https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status/history/?trackingId=FNJ8-VQZ. This was mitigated by rolling back the policy change, which started at 22:15 UTC.  As VMs came back online, our runners worked through the backlog of requests that hadn’t timed out. <br /><br />We are working with our compute provider to improve our incident response and engagement time, improve early detection before they impact our customers, and ensure safe rollout should similar changes occur in the future. We recognize this was a significant outage to our users that rely on GitHub’s workloads and apologize for the impact this had.",

Impacted users could observe Actions finish successfully but the session UI continuing to show in-progress state, or sessions remaining in queued state.<br /><br />The issue was caused by a feature flag that resulted in events being published to a new Kafka topic. Publishing failures led to buffer/queue overflows in the shared event publishing client, preventing other critical events from being emitted. We mitigated the incident by disabling the feature flag and redeploying production pods, which resumed normal event delivery. We are working to improve safeguards and detection around event publishing failures to reduce time to mitigation for similar issues in the future.",

The issue was traced to performance degradation under load due to an issue in upstream database caching capability within our billing infrastructure, which increased query latency to retrieve billing and policy information from approximately 300ms to up to 1.5s.<br /><br />To restore service, we disabled the affected caching feature, which immediately returned performance to normal. We then addressed the issue in the caching capability and re-enabled our use of the database cache and observed continued recovery.<br /><br />Moving forward, we’re tightening our procedures for deploying performance optimizations, adding test coverage, and improving cross-service visibility and alerting so we can detect upstream degradations earlier and reduce impact to customers.",

GitHub products built on Actions such as Dependabot, Pages builds, and Copilot coding agent experienced similar delays. All jobs successfully completed despite the delays. At peak impact, approximately 23% of workflow runs were affected, with an average delay of 11 minutes.<br /><br />This was caused by a load pattern shift in Actions scheduled jobs that saturated a shared backend resource. We mitigated the incident by temporarily throttling traffic and scaling up resources to account for the change in load pattern. To prevent recurrence, we have scaled resources appropriately and implemented optimizations to prevent this load pattern in the future.",

This caused delays in runner creation, resulting in delayed job starts for workflows targeting those runners. The root cause was a service to service circuit breaker that incorrectly tripped for all users when a single user hit rate limits for runner registration. The issue was mitigated by bypassing the circuit breaker, and users saw immediate and full service recovery following the fix.<br /><br />We have updated our circuit breakers to exclude individual customer rate limits from their triggering logic and are continuing work to improve detection and mitigation times.",

          "body": "On January 15, 2026,  between 16:40 UTC and 18:20 UTC, we observed increased latency and timeouts across Issues, Pull Requests, Notifications, Actions, Repositories, API, Account Login and Alive. An average 1.8% of combined web and API requests saw failure, peaking briefly at 10% early on. The majority of impact was observed for unauthenticated users, but authenticated users were impacted as well.<br /><br />This was caused by an infrastructure update to some of our data stores. Upgrading this infrastructure to a new major version resulted in unexpected resource contention, leading to distributed impact in the form of slow queries and increased timeouts across services that depend on these datasets. We mitigated this by rolling back to the previous stable version.<br /><br />We are working to improve our validation process for these types of upgrades to catch issues that only occur under high load before full release, improve detection time, and reduce mitigation times in the future.",

Status updates were delayed by up to 20 minutes, with a median delay of 11 minutes.<br /><br />The issue stemmed from an infrastructure upgrade to our database cluster. The new version introduced resource contention under production load, causing slow query times. We mitigated this by rolling back to the previous stable version. We are working to strengthen our upgrade validation process to catch issues that only manifest under high load. We are also adding new monitors to reduce detection time for similar issues in the future.",

Previously, webhook deliveries encountering this error would not have been delivered.<br /><br />The incident was mitigated by rolling back the change, restoring normal webhook delivery. <br /><br />As a corrective action, we will update our monitoring to measure the webhook delivery latency critical path, ensuring that incidents are accurately scoped to this workflow.",

          "body": "On January 13th, 2026, between 09:25 UTC and 10:11 UTC, GitHub Copilot experienced unavailability. During this window, error rates averaged 18% and peaked at 100% of service requests, leading to an outage of chat features across Copilot Chat, VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, and other Copilot-dependent products. <br /><br />This incident was triggered by a configuration error during a model update. We mitigated the incident by rolling back this change. However, a second recovery phase lasted until 10:46 UTC, due to unexpected latency with the GPT 4.1 model. To prevent recurrence, we are investing in new monitors and more robust testing environments to reduce further misconfigurations, and to improve our time to detection and mitigation of future issues.",

Due to a bug, the change triggered an unrelated protection mechanism which determines if setup has already been attempted on the VM and caused the VM to be marked unhealthy. Only Linux images which were generated while the change was enabled were impacted. The issue was mitigated by rolling back the change.<br /><br />We are improving our testing around Custom Image generation as part of our GA readiness process for the public preview feature..

Since the page displays only the most recent 24 hours of activity, once processing delays exceeded this threshold, no recent data was visible. Session data remained available in audit logs throughout the incident.<br /><br />Inefficient database queries in the data processing pipeline caused significant processing latency, creating a multi-day backlog. As the backlog grew, the delay between when sessions occurred and when they appeared on the page increased, eventually exceeding the 24-hour display window.<br /><br />The issue was resolved on January 10, 2026, 02:30 UTC, after query optimizations and a database index were deployed.

Approximately 1.5% of jobs on larger and standard hosted runners in the West US region were impacted, 0.28% of all Actions jobs during this period.<br /><br />By 17:11 UTC, all traffic was routed away from the affected edge site, mitigating the timeouts.

          "body": "On December 15, 2025, between 15:15 UTC and 18:22 UTC, Copilot Code Review experienced a service degradation that caused 46.97% of pull request review requests to fail, requiring users to re-request a review. Impacted users saw the error message: “Copilot encountered an error and was unable to review this pull request. You can try again by re-requesting a review.” The remaining requests completed successfully.<br /><br />The degradation was caused by elevated response times in an internal, model-backed dependency, which led to request timeouts and backpressure in the review processing pipeline, resulting in sustained queue growth and failed review completion.<br /><br />We mitigated the issue by temporarily bypassing fix suggestions to reduce latency, increasing worker capacity to drain the backlog, and rolling out a model configuration change that reduced end-to-end latency. Queue depth and request success rates returned to normal and remained stable through peak traffic.<br /><br />Following the incident, we increased baseline worker capacity, added instrumentation for worker utilization and queue health, and are improving automatic load-shedding, fallback behavior, and alerting to reduce time to detection and mitigation for similar issues.",

We mitigated this by deleting the runner.<br /><br />The routing configuration is not something controlled externally. A manual override was done previously for internal testing, but left incorrect metadata for a large runner instance. An infrastructure migration caused this misconfigured runner to come online which started the incorrect assignments. We are removing the ability to manually override this configuration entirely, and are adding alerting to identify possible OS mismatches for hosted runner jobs.<br /><br />As a reminder, hosted runner VMs are secure and ephemeral, with every VM reimaged after every single job. All jobs impacted here were originally targeted at a GitHub-owned VM image and were run on a GitHub-owned VM image.",

All jobs successfully completed despite the delays. At peak impact, approximately 8% of workflow runs were affected.<br /><br />During this incident, some nodes received a spike in workflow events that led to queuing of event processing. Because runs are pinned to nodes, runs being processed by these nodes saw delays in starting or showing as completed. The team was alerted to this at 8:58 UTC. Impacted nodes were disabled from processing new jobs to allow queues to drain.<br /><br />We have increased overall processing capacity and are implementing safeguards to better balance load across all nodes when spikes occur.

The incident was triggered by a buildup of synchronization requests, resulting in elevated Redis key usage and high CPU consumption on the underlying Redis cluster.<br /><br />To mitigate further impact, we proactively paused all team synchronization requests between 3:00 pm UTC and 8:15 pm UTC, allowing us to stabilize the Redis cluster. Our engineering team also resolved the issue by flushing the affected Redis keys and queues, which promptly stopped runaway growth and restored service health. Additionally, we scaled up our infrastructure resources to improve our ability to process the high volume of synchronization requests. All pending team synchronizations were successfully processed following service restoration.<br /><br />We are working to strengthen the Team Synchronization service by implementing a killswitch, adding throttling to prevent excessive enqueueing of synchronization requests, and improving the scheduler to avoid duplicate job requests. Additionally, we’re investing in better observability to alert when job drops occur. These efforts are focused on preventing similar incidents and improving overall reliability going forward.",
