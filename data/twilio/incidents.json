The Month End for December usage was run on January 5th, during which metadata which had been changed during this configuration event was used to produce invoices for 89,097 accounts. The misconfiguration led to invoices assigning BIs to incorrect countries. This led to 5 customer contacts, with some customers delaying paying their invoices pending an updated invoice. The issue was escalated to engineering on January 25th as a single customer incident. Further triage identified the breadth of the problem and causes by February 2nd. The issue was resolved when revised invoices were sent to 5497 Invoiced customers and 6,357 PAYG customers that are configured to have invoices emailed to them on February 6th.",
