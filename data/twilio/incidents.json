To be impacted, devices would need to both be configured to use the 'sg1.super' APN and be using one of the impacted IMSIs to connect to the cellular networks. The 'sg1.super' APN directs Super SIM traffic to our distributed internet breakout location in Singapore. Assuming that only devices deployed in APAC or Oceania regions would be configured to the use the 'sg1.super' APN to benefit from the lower latency offered by a closer breakout location, the countries with devices most likely to be impacted are Australia, Singapore, India, and the United Arab Emirates. For other countries throughout APAC and Oceania, other, non-impacted IMSIs are preferred. However, devices deployed elsewhere in the world that are configured to use the 'sg1.super' APN may be impacted if the impacted IMSIs are preferred in those countries. If you believe you have been impacted and are able to change the APN on your devices, you can set the APN to 'super' and your data will breakout in Virginia, USA.",
