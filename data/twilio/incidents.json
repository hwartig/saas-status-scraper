The majority of our services have recovered however we are experiencing some service disruptions due to the AWS outage affecting the US-1 Region.\nRecovery is progressing, and we are seeing improvement across most services. Programmable Voice, Flex & TaskRouter, Studio, Programmable Messaging, WhatsApp, SendGrid / Marketing Campaigns, Verify, Lookup, Serverless Functions & Assets, and Event Streams have largely recovered, though occasional transient errors may still occur.\nPSTN remains impacted, with continued latency errors when connecting calls.\nRequests with a Twilio success code remain queued for delivery upon recovery, while those that resulted in failure codes will need to be resent once services are fully restored. We do not anticipate any data loss once recovery is complete. Twilio teams continue to work closely with AWS to address remaining connectivity and capacity issues and are monitoring the situation closely. We will provide another update within 60 minutes or as soon as additional information becomes available.",

The majority of our services have recovered, however we are experiencing some service disruptions due to the AWS outage affecting the US-1 Region. \n\nRecovery is progressing, and we are seeing improvement across most services. Programmable Voice, Flex & TaskRouter, Studio, Programmable Messaging, WhatsApp, SendGrid / Marketing Campaigns, Verify, and Lookup have largely recovered, though occasional transient errors may still occur.\n\nServerless – Functions and assets remains impacted, with continued latency errors and invocation failures. Event Streams is also facing delays in the delivery of some events. We are actively monitoring this service and working to resolve the issues.\n\nRequests with a Twilio success code remain queued for delivery upon recovery, while those that resulted in failure codes will need to be resent once services are fully restored. We do not anticipate any data loss once recovery is complete. Twilio teams continue to work closely with AWS to address remaining connectivity and capacity issues and are monitoring the situation closely. We will provide another update within 60 minutes or as soon as additional information becomes available.",

Twilio teams are working closely with AWS to resolve remaining connectivity and capacity issues and to ensure ongoing stability across all regions.\n\nWe are seeing continued improvement across most products; however, AWS is still performing remediation actions, and intermittent errors may continue until their work is fully complete.\n\nKey services impacted include Functions and Assets, which continue to experience invocation failures. Programmable Voice, Flex & TaskRouter, Studio, Programmable Messaging, and WhatsApp have largely recovered but may still encounter occasional transient errors. SendGrid / Marketing Campaigns customers may continue to see intermittent delays or errors when sending or managing campaigns. Verify traffic remains partially impacted, with a small portion (~0.1%) returning HTTP 503 errors and elevated latency. Lookup is recovering, but still shows increased latency.\n\nRequests with a Twilio success code remain queued for delivery upon recovery, while those that resulted in failure codes will need to be resent once services are fully restored. We do not anticipate data loss once recovery is complete. Twilio has scaled systems to service current loads and continues to monitor the situation closely. We will provide an update within 60 minutes or as soon as more information becomes available.",

Our teams are working closely with AWS to resolve connectivity and stability issues. The impact extends to cross-region networking and US1 east, causing intermittent performance degradation.\n\nKey services impacted include Programmable Voice, Flex & TaskRouter, Studio, Functions, Assets, and Programmable Messaging, with varying degrees of recovery. For WhatsApp, a small number of MMS messages are experiencing delays, while non-MMS traffic appears to be functional and delivering on time. Requests with a Twilio success code are queued for delivery upon recovery, while those with failure codes need resending post-restoration. We anticipate no data loss once recovery is achieved. Twilio has scaled systems to service current loads and continues to monitor the situations. We will provide an update within 60 minutes or as soon as we have more information.",

Our teams are working closely with AWS to resolve connectivity and stability issues. The impact extends to cross-region networking and US1 east, causing intermittent performance degradation.\n\nKey services impacted include Programmable Voice, Flex & TaskRouter, Studio, Functions, Assets, and Programmable Messaging, with varying degrees of recovery. For WhatsApp, a small number of MMS messages are experiencing delays, while non-MMS traffic appears to be functional and delivering on time. Requests with a Twilio success code are queued for delivery upon recovery, while those with failure codes need resending post-restoration. We anticipate no data loss once recovery is achieved. Twilio has scaled systems to service current loads and continues to monitor the situations. We will provide an update within 60 minutes or as soon as we have more information.",

Our teams are working closely with AWS to resolve connectivity and capacity issues. The impact extends to cross-region networking and US1 east, causing intermittent performance degradation.\n\nKey services impacted include Programmable Voice, Flex & Task Router, Studio, Functions, Assets, and Programmable Messaging with varying degrees of recovery. Requests with a Twilio success code are queued for delivery upon recovery, while those with failure codes need resending post-restoration. We anticipate no data loss once recovery is achieved. Twilio has scaled systems to service current loads and continues to monitor the situations. We will provide an update within 60 minutes or as soon as we have more information.",

AWS has confirmed EC2 is impacted as well.\n\nWe have activated our incident response team and have all hands on deck working on remediation. We are partnering directly with AWS on the incident and have also escalated to their leadership. At this time we do not recommend trying to take any failover action to alternative Regions.

AWS has confirmed EC2 is impacted as well.\n\nWe have activated our incident response team and have all hands on deck working on remediation. We are partnering directly with AWS on the incident and have also escalated to their leadership. At this time we do not recommend trying to take any failover action to alternative Regions.

We are partnering directly with AWS on the incident and have also escalated to their leadership. At this time we do not recommend trying to take any failover action to alternative Regions.
