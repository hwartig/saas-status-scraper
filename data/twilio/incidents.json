Our engineering team is actively working alongside the affected network provider to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. In the meantime, we kindly suggest that customers reset the connectivity through the console or through the APIs (by reactivating SIMs) if they notice that some of their SIM cards are still experiencing issues. We will provide another update in 4 hours or sooner once more information becomes available.",
