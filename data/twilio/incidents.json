Devices that were already connected to a cellular network and had an active data session may not have experienced any impact. At 10:07 UTC, all signalling traffic from the impacted partner was lost. At this point, all new attachments and location updates for devices using IMSIs from the impacted parter were expected to fail. Super SIMs should have begun to fallback to other IMSIs on the SIM if devices were previously using the impacted partner IMSIs and were now failing to connect. We observed an increase in the number of new connections on IMSIs from other partners during this time. At 11:39 UTC, signalling traffic from the impacted partner resumed and new attachments were successful again. However, our engineers are working to resolve the issue.
