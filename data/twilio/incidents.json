This disruption means users may experience difficulties logging into the KORE Console (https://console.korewireless.com/) and may be restricted from linking or verifying accounts in the console. Additionally, viewing invoices will be restricted for those with linked and verified accounts.\nImportantly, this does not affect customer SIM management activities, which remain fully operational within the Twilio Console. However, customers will not see amounts billed for data usage when viewing Usage in Console or via the UsageRecords APIs for both Programmable Wireless and Super SIM until the incident is mitigated. There are no delays in reporting the amount of bytes used by these SIMs. The amounts billed will be updated once the incident is resolved and delayed records are processed.
