Devices that attempted to reconnect immediately after losing connectivity should have been able to successfully reconnect to the redundant instances while the impacted instance recovered. Our engineering team is actively working with the affected network provider to resolve the issue. We will provide another update in 1 hour or as soon as more information becomes available.\nIn the meantime, we kindly suggest that customers reset the connectivity through the console if they notice that some of their SIM cards are still experiencing issues. This can often help re-establish a stable connection for the affected devices.",
