This means messages to Syriatel can only be delivered when sent from a registered alphanumeric Sender ID; no other Sender ID types are supported.\n\nPlease note that in July 2025, Twilio announced through direct customer communications that SMS delivery to Syria will no longer be supported starting September 15, 2025. Customers were advised to remove Syria traffic from Twilio and transition to alternative messaging providers.\n\nFrom now until September 15, 2025, SMS delivery to Syriatel in Syria will be on a best-effort basis only. If messages fail, Twilio will not be able to provide troubleshooting support. After September 15, 2025, all messaging traffic to Syria will be blocked.",
