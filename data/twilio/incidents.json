This would have caused your account balance to appear lower than it should and may have led to your credit card being charged to bring your account balance back up to amount set in your auto recharge settings. Our engineering team is currently working on stopping the double counting of the usage so your balance will be correctly reflected, including any additional funds that may have been added to your account from your auto recharge being triggered.",
