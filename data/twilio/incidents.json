O2 has, without notice, blocked all inbound LTE-M traffic from SIMs roaming on their network. This is not just impacting our products, but also products from other providers roaming onto O2’s network. We are engaged with our multiple tier-1 carrier partners who have also been impacted and are working toward a resolution of this matter.\nO2 is the only LTE-M network in the UK to which Super SIM can connect. Devices able to use 2G, which many LTE-M modems also support, should have been able to maintain their connectivity by connecting to various 2G networks offered in the UK. If you are planning to release LTE-M enabled devices into the UK, please ensure they also support 2G and that it’s enabled for fallback on your devices. \nThere is currently no timeline for when LTE-M connectivity on O2 will be restored for SIMs roaming onto their network. We do not expect this matter to be resolved in a matter of days. We intend to keep this incident posted until Monday, December 11th, after which it will be closed. We will provide updates if we get any new details.
