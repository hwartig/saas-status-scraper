This will expand to mobile numbers (like +36 20, 30, 70...) starting June 1, 2026.\n\nThis means calls made with Transit Caller ID and Verified Caller ID will be delivered by Twilio on a best-effort basis when you're using a Hungarian CLI.\n\nRecommended steps:\n- For calls made into Hungary using Verified Caller ID or Transit Caller ID avoid using Hungarian numbers (+36 1-9… and +36 20, 30, 70...) as your CLI as the calls are likely to be blocked.\n- If a Hungary CLI isn’t a priority for your use case, use a non-Hungarian CLI like your main business or international service number. If you need one, you can quickly get a United States (+1) number right in the Twilio Console to use for these calls.\n\nIf you observe abnormal failure patterns, please reach out to Twilio Support for further assistance.",
