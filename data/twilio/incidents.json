This will expand to mobile numbers (like +36 20, 30, 70...) starting June 1, 2026.\n\nThis means calls made with Transit Caller ID and Verified Caller ID will be delivered by Twilio on a best-effort basis when you're using a Hungarian CLI.\n\nRecommended steps:\n- For calls made into Hungary using Verified Caller ID or Transit Caller ID avoid using Hungarian numbers (+36 1-9… and +36 20, 30, 70...) as your CLI as the calls are likely to be blocked.\n- If a Hungary CLI isn’t a priority for your use case, use a non-Hungarian CLI like your main business or international service number. If you need one, you can quickly get a United States (+1) number right in the Twilio Console to use for these calls.\n\nIf you observe abnormal failure patterns, please reach out to Twilio Support for further assistance.",

This will expand to mobile numbers (like +36 20, 30, 70...) starting June 1, 2026.\n\nThis means calls made with Transit Caller ID and Verified Caller ID will be delivered by Twilio on a best-effort basis when you're using a Hungarian CLI.\n\nRecommended steps:\n- For calls made into Hungary using Verified Caller ID or Transit Caller ID avoid using Hungarian numbers (+36 1-9… and +36 20, 30, 70...) as your CLI as the calls are likely to be blocked.\n- If a Hungary CLI isn’t a priority for your use case, use a non-Hungarian CLI like your main business or international service number.
