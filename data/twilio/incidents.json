Currently, we are still monitoring the situation as approximately 15% of devices may still experience connectivity issues. These devices might encounter poor data connection or have short-lived sessions and as such are not able to successfully perform an IMSI switching procedure. Our engineering team is actively working alongside the affected network provider to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. In the meantime, we kindly suggest that customers reset the connectivity through the console if they notice that some of their SIM cards are still experiencing issues. This can often help re-establish a stable connection for the affected devices. We will provide another update in 4 hours or sooner once more information becomes available.",
