During this upgrade, an outdated configuration was accidentally deployed to the Hubs production environment. This issue prevented the Hubs service from starting correctly, leading to Stoplight Next documentation sites being temporarily unavailable from approximately 4:10 until 4:25PM CST. Once the issue was identified, the configuration was reverted and the service was restored.\n\nWe sincerely apologize for any inconvenience posed by this outage. We have updated our internal upgrade process to re-validate configurations before applying them to ensure this issue does not happen again.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out to support@stoplight.io if you have any further questions or concerns regarding this issue.",
