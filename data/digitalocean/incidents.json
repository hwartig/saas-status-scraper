This kernel version has exhibited stability problems that can lead to Droplets becoming unresponsive intermittently. Customers running Ubuntu 20.04 with kernel 5.4.0-122-generic are advised to upgrade to a newer kernel version using the commands below:\n\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade linux-virtual\n\nThis problem is fixed with the newer kernel 5.4.0-123.139. The recommended option is to migrate to a more recent and fully supported OS version, such as Ubuntu 24.04, to ensure continued system stability and support.
