          "body": "# Incident Summary\n\nOn Thursday, November 28, 2024, our domain registrar, Network Solutions, made an update to our [digitaloceanspaces.com](http://digitaloceanspaces.com) domain. The change made at 22:38 UTC \\(5:38:40PM ET\\) added an Extensible Provisioning Protocol \\(EPP\\) [clientHold](https://icann.org/epp#clientHold) status code to our domain.\n\nThe code prevents DNS resolution until a customer contacts Network Solutions to clear the hold. The impact of the hold resulted in DigitalOcean customers being unable to sign-up/log-in via the Cloud Control Panel at the beginning of the incident and experiencing errors with Spaces buckets and dependent services, such as DigitalOcean Container Registry, App Platform, Functions, Load Balancers, and Mongo Managed Database Backups for the duration of the incident. \n\n# Incident Summary\n\n**Root Cause:** Domain registrar erroneously placed a clientHold on the [digitaloceanspaces.com](http://digitaloceanspaces.com) domain, impacting DNS resolution and causing an outage.\n\n**Impact:** Traffic to DigitalOcean products \\(e.g. Cloud Control Panel, Spaces, App Platform, etc.\\) began to see intermittent failures between 11/28 22:38 UTC and 04:03 UTC, with the worst failures happening between 03:00 and 04:03 UTC as DNS cache and TTLs began expiring.\n\n**Response:** DigitalOcean escalated to the domain registrar, as well as Verisign \\(as the authoritative domain registry for .com domains\\), to have the clientHold removed. \n\n# Timeline of Events\n\nNovember 28, 2024 \\(UTC\\)\n\n* 22:38 - Incident declared based on monitoring and customer reports of our Cloud Control Panel not loading.\n* 22:44 -  Issue detected by an internal alert\n* 22:57 - 1st customer contact regarding Cloud Control Panel impact\n* 23:57 - We noticed that our whois information for the domain had been updated on November 28 22:38 UTC.\n\nNovember 29, 2024 \\(UTC\\)\n\n* 01:06 - We identified the clientHold status in the EPP section of our whois for [digitaloceanspaces.com](http://digitaloceanspaces.com) and confirmed in our Network Solutions account that the domain had been marked inactive.\n* 01:08 - We initiated contact with Network Solutions to have the clientHold removed.\n* 01:30 - Reached out to Verisign executives to assistance \n* 01:42 - **Cloud Control Panel functionality restored**. \n* 02:40 - Conference call with Verisign executive to brief them on the issue\\(s\\) we have encountered attempting to resolve the clientHold status.\n* 02:44 - Email chain established with Verisign executives. A recap of all work done, problems, and a clear issue resolution request were sent.\n* 02:44 - 04:03 - Multiple escalations between Verisign executives leading to clientHold being removed.\n* 03:00 - As DNS caches and recursive DNS server TTLs began to expire, we saw the most severe service disruptions to our customers until resolution\n* 04:03 - clientHold removed from domain\n* 04:03 - 5:38:40 - Monitoring all infrastructure to ensure healthy and full recovery. **DigitalOcean functionality fully restored.**\n\n# Remediation Actions\n\nDigitalOcean teams are working on multiple types of remediation to prevent a similar incident from happening.\n\nDigitalOcean is working with Network Solutions to understand what happened on their end that resulted in the clientHold being applied to our domain incorrectly.\n\nIn addition, we are reviewing other domain registrars as possible new homes for our domains.\n\nTeams are also reviewing our monitoring and alerting to reduce our time to detect incidents related to registrar imposed changes and/or DNS resolution.",

          "body": "## **Incident Summary**\n\nOn September 25, 2024 at 22:25 UTC, DigitalOcean experienced a reduction of datacenter capacity in SFO3 and impacted the availability of select DigitalOcean services. Due to a majority of the line cards rebooting at the same time on one of our core routers in SFO3, an inter-regional traffic interruption and traffic drop to the network backbone occurred. This issue impacted users of any DigitalOcean services in the SFO3 region, with a longer impact on select Managed Kubernetes Clusters \\(DOKS\\). \n\n‌\n\n## **Incident Details**\n\n_Networking_\n\n* **Root Cause**: Several line cards rebooted at the same time on one of the core routers, due to hardware errors on the network device.\n* **Impact**: Datacenter traffic capacity to/from the backbone was reduced by half during this incident. Network connectivity to some DigitalOcean services was affected.\n* **Response**: All of the crashed line cards came online quickly, allowing network traffic to begin flowing again and the core router to become operational.\n\n_Specific Impact on DOKS_\n\n* **Root Cause:** Due to the network issues from line card reboots, a number of DOKS fleet machines became unhealthy as guest networking failed to recover from the hardware fault.\n* **Impact:** Some customer clusters experienced connectivity issues and difficulty in accessing the K8s control plane until networking for the underlying nodes was restored.\n* **Response:** All affected nodes across the SFO3 region in the DOKS fleet were recycled.\n\n## **Timeline of Events**\n\nSep 25 22:21 - Large majority of line cards rebooted on the core router.\n\nSep 25 22:24 - Line cards became online.\n\nSep 25 22:25 - Network protocols started session establishment process.\n\nSep 25 22:30 - Traffic on the affected core router was restored.\n\nSep 25 22:50 - SFO3 control plane systems all reconnected and recovered. \n\nSep 25 23:07 - DOKS API servers degraded.\n\nSep 25 23:59 - Some DOKS clusters in the SFO3 region could not be scraped. Several nodes were discovered to be in a “not ready” state.\n\nSep 26 01:40 - All impacted DOKS nodes recycled and clusters are operational. \n\n## **Remediation Actions**\n\nDigitalOcean teams are working on multiple types of remediation to help prevent a similar incident from happening in the future. \n\nDigitalOcean is working with the vendor support team for the devices to determine the root cause of the line card crash, as well as upgrading software on the core routers in the SFO3 region.. \n\nDuring the incident, engineers had to manually remediate affected nodes across the entire SFO3 DOKS fleet to restore service. Teams are exploring methods to reduce the need for manual action in the future, by increasing thresholds for automated remediation actions, such that service is restored as quickly as possible.",
