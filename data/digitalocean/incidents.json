          "body": "Our Engineering team has continued to actively monitor the situation resulting from multiple subsea fiber faults in the APAC region. Over the last ten days, network connectivity on routes from Singapore to San Francisco and Singapore to Europe has not experienced any major packet loss or latency. Network routes to and from Bangalore also have not experienced any major packet loss or latency. Crews have been able to complete some cable repairs, leading to the stability for the routes mentioned. \n\nOur team is still observing daily packet loss and latency on network routes between Singapore and New York City, as well as Singapore and Toronto. These are normally short-lived and happen during Singapore business hours when traffic is heavy. \n\nRepair of all cables from crews is still pending and may continue for multiple weeks. Given the relative stability of routes, we will now close out this incident and provide any needed updates separately. \n\nIf users experience a disruption in service or have any questions, we invite them to submit a support ticket from within their account. \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding throughout this incident.\n\nResolved: May 01, 2023 - 15:58 UTC\n\n-\n\nUpdate\nAround 07:00 UTC, we saw a small period of increased loss, due to increased traffic and congestion in the APAC region. This self-recovered and since then, we have not seen further periods of decreased performance.  About two hours later, we experienced an unrelated issue in BLR1, details of which can be found here: https://status.digitalocean.com/incidents/6qr2q9yc9790. We originally believed the impact in BLR1 to be due to this incident, but confirmed it was a separate issue. We apologize for any confusion.\n\nAs a reminder, we expect periods of increased loss and latency to continue to occur, but they are normally short-lived, and most happen during APAC business hours due to increased traffic and congestion.\n\nWe continue to await the fiber fault repairs and make traffic routing changes when available for better performance. We expect the situation to continue to improve over the coming month as crews continue and complete work.\nMar 29, 2023 - 10:25 UTC\n\n-\n\nUpdate\n\nBetween 10:20 - 11:10 UTC, we experienced an uptick in loss and latency in the APAC region, due to a downstream effect of this incident. During this time, we saw a slight dip in public API availability, meaning a small subset of users may have experienced errors while sending requests. Users would have also seen loss and latency on Droplets and Droplet-based services in the APAC region. \n\nPeriods of increased loss and latency continue to occur, but are normally short-lived, and most happen during APAC business hours due to increased traffic and congestion. \n\nWe continue to await the fiber fault repairs and make traffic routing changes when available for better performance. We expect the situation to continue to improve over the coming month as crews continue and complete work.\n\nMar 28, 2023 - 17:54 UTC\n\n-\nIdentified\nOur Engineering team has observed recurring incidents that are continuing to affect our customers' resources in the APAC region. As a result, some users may be experiencing packet loss and increased latency in this area. Our team is actively monitoring the situation and implementing traffic routing changes where applicable to alleviate the congestion. \n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience caused and will provide updates as the situation progresses.\nMar 08, 2023 - 13:31 UTC\n\n-\n\nMonitoring\nThe situation with network performance in the APAC region has continually improved in the past few weeks as repairs have progressed and traffic optimization to route around affected paths has continued. We have now been observing normal latency and zero packet loss for a few days, so we will move this incident to a Monitoring state for a few days. If the improvements we’ve seen continue, we’ll look to close this out and provide any further updates separately. Thank you for your patience as this situation unfolded and our Network Engineering team worked around it.\nMar 07, 2023 - 20:56 UTC\n\n-\n\nUpdate\nOur Engineering team continues to monitor network performance in the APAC region and make routing changes as needed to alleviate performance concerns. \n\nCustomers are still experiencing periodic performance and connectivity issues and will continue to experience those issues until restoration efforts are completed by upstream providers for the undersea cable cuts (fiber faults) in the APAC region.\n\nFull repair is expected to take multiple weeks. We will continue to communicate any updates we receive.\nFeb 27, 2023 - 16:34 UTC\n\n-\n\nUpdate\nOur Engineering team is continuing to take actions to mitigate customer impact and monitor the ongoing issues with network connectivity in the APAC region. Performance has been relatively stable as traffic is slowly increasing across the rerouted network. However, some customers may still experience periodic performance and connectivity issues until restoration efforts are completed by the upstream providers.\n\nWe have no ETA for the upstream issue being completely resolved, but we will continue to communicate any relevant information as soon as it is available to us. Thank you for your patience and we apologize for the inconvenience.\nFeb 04, 2023 - 18:33 UTC\n\n-\n\nUpdate\nOur Engineering team has made routing changes for some traffic to work around the congestion caused by multiple subsea fiber faults in the APAC region. We are slowly ramping up traffic on this new route and are carefully monitoring for the next 24 hours. \n\nWhile this new route is expected to help ease some of the packet loss and latency from the APAC region fiber faults, we expect some users to still experience performance and connectivity drops until the faults are resolved.\n\nWe have no ETA for the upstream issues being restored but we will communicate any relevant information as we have it. We apologize for the inconvenience.\nFeb 03, 2023 - 17:58 UTC\n\n-\n\nUpdate\nOur Engineering team continues to monitor the ongoing issue with multiple subsea fiber faults in the APAC region. We have experienced multiple periods of packet loss and increased latency and expect to continue to see those until the issue is resolved upstream. Our team will continue observing performance and making traffic routing changes where applicable/available to work around the congestion. \n\nWhile we have no ETA for the faults being restored, we will communicate updates as we have them. If you have questions or concerns about impacted services from this incident, we ask that you open a Support ticket from within your account. Thank you!\nFeb 01, 2023 - 23:55 UTC\n\n-\n\nUpdate\nOur Engineering team is continuing to work with upstream providers to fix the network connectivity issues we are experiencing in the SGP1 region. The problems appear to be a direct result of multiple subsea fiber faults in the APAC region causing congestion resulting in packet loss and increased latency connecting to the SGP1 region.\n\nAt this time users will continue experiencing intermittent timeout errors with Droplet-based services in the SGP1 region. We do not have a firm ETA for resolution time but we will provide updates as needed. Thank you for your patience and we apologize for any inconvenience.\nJan 30, 2023 - 06:48 UTC\n\n-\n\nUpdate\nOur team is continuing to work on a fix for this issue. We will provide an update in the due course along with more information about this problem. We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience and continued support.\nJan 29, 2023 - 20:47 UTC\n\n-\n\nIdentified\nAs of 12:00 UTC, our Engineering team has again identified an issue with an upstream provider causing packet loss and increased latency in the SGP1 region. Users may have been experiencing degraded performance including timeout errors with Droplet-based services in SGP1. Please note that the concerned team is actually working on a fix and we will share an update once we have further information.\nJan 29, 2023 - 16:27 UTC",

          "body": "Postmortem\nThe Incident\n‌\n\nBeginning at 04:58 UTC, January 29th, the DigitalOcean NYC3 data center region experienced an Internet connection outage. This prevented Droplets and Droplet-based services, App Platform, Load Balancers, and Spaces in that data center region from accessing the Internet during the outages. Additionally, users were unable to access the Cloud Control Panel and the DigitalOcean API during the outage and event processing failures were evident in all regions. Customers may have also seen some gaps in metrics and monitoring during the incident. This incident was triggered by a software bug in the border (edge) routers of the NYC3 region.\n\n‌\n\nOur engineers were able to detect and begin an incident response for this issue within minutes of the first signs of impact. We quickly determined the root cause and began remediation efforts.\n\n‌\n\nThe root cause was discovered to be a bug in the operating system software of critical edge routing hardware, causing these routing systems to crash. The bug was triggered by interpretation of automatically propagated routes. Routers propagate routing information between redundant nodes as efficiently as possible to avoid errors. This behavior of standard routing protocols, coupled with the bug, caused clustered routers to crash nearly concurrently.\n\n‌\n\nWithout the routing service, the edge routers quickly degraded and stopped serving traffic. This cut off the DigitalOcean network behind the edge routers in question from the rest of the Internet during these crashes. Besides impact to customers, the lack of external network access complicated efforts to troubleshoot and fix problems and spread secondary impacts to nearly all DigitalOcean services. The core problem occurred in three waves. The initial outage consisted of 16 minutes of Internet connectivity loss, followed by two 15-minute periods of network congestion, and finally 50 minutes of congestion, as traffic was redirected to perform software upgrades.\n\n‌\n\nTo fix this issue, DigitalOcean engineers deployed emergency software upgrades to the impacted systems. These upgrades were the most time-consuming part of the response and, when completed, they resolved the bug in the impacted systems for the long term. Internet access at the expected performance levels was restored for Cloud, API, Droplets, Droplet-based services like Managed Kubernetes and Load Balancers, App Platform, Functions, Monitoring, and Spaces by the end of the emergency software upgrades. Some asynchronous customer-triggered events like power offs and resizes were stuck until DigitalOcean engineers completed manual cleanup of affected events after the incident.\n\nTimeline of Events\n‌\n\nUTC Timeline\n\n04:58 - Both edge routers crash in NYC3, causing a complete outage for NYC3 for customer and internal services, as well as global impact to some services.05:05 - Internal incident response begins.\n\n05:12 - Network Engineering team gains access to the edge routers in NYC3 and begins investigation.\n\n05:13 - Network Engineering team sees the routing process crashed.\n\n05:14 - Edge1 recovered and took traffic. Complete outage ends, congestion exists for customer and internal services.\n\n05:21 - Multiple Engineering teams across DigitalOcean still reporting down alerts. Network Engineering team sees that memory is exhausted on Edge2.\n\n05:27 - Multiple Engineering teams confirm alerts are clearing and that cloud.digitalocean.com is accessible again.\n\n05:40 - Edge2 recovered after manual intervention caused by hardware failure. Congestion ends for customer and internal services.\n\n06:06 - Public status page posted with information about the outage .\n\n06:24 - Edge1 crashes for a second time, causing customers to be unable to access or experience latency with Droplets and Droplet-based services via public/private networks.\n\n06:36 - Network Engineering team makes the decision to emergency upgrade software on Edge1 to a newer version to help mitigate the crashes.\n\n06:41 - Edge1 recovers and is able to take traffic again.\n\n06:52 - Edge2 crashes for a second time, causing customers to be unable to access or experience latency with Droplets and Droplet-based services via public/private networks.\n\n06:59 - Network Engineering team confirms Edge2 needs to recover before starting the software upgrade for Edge1.\n\n07:07 - Edge2 recovered and took traffic.\n\n07:08 - Network Engineering team begins to drain traffic away from Edge1 in preparation for upgrade. Congestion to Droplets and Droplet-based services in NYC3 begins.\n\n07:23 - Edge1 is rebooted to apply the software upgrade.\n\n07:44 - Network Engineering team brings Edge1 online and it begins to take traffic.\n\n07:56 - Edge1 upgrade complete, traffic restored. Congestion ends.\n\n08:09 - Network Engineering team begins to drain traffic away from Edge2 in preparation for upgrade. Congestion to Droplets and Droplet-based services in NYC3 begins.\n\n08:18 - Edge2 is rebooted to apply the software upgrade.\n\n09:05 - Network Engineering team confirms both edge routers are upgraded and traffic is balanced between them. All customer impact confirmed over.\n\nFuture Measures\nThe current and ongoing network infrastructure upgrade scheduled to be completed in the first half of 2023 aims to improve overall network performance and stability. As of today, SYD1, SGP1, and BLR1 are the completed regions for this overarching upgrade and are running on the new network infrastructure.\n\n‌\n\nAs a result of these upgrades, users can expect a smoother and more efficient experience when using the network by increasing bandwidth and enhancing availability. To achieve this, the upgrade utilizes updated hardware and software, fixing any bugs that existed in the previous network setup.\n\n‌\n\nIn addition to the immediate benefits, there is a long-term plan to address potential vulnerabilities. This includes a proof of concept, scheduled for 2023, which focuses on implementing vendor diversity. This strategy will reduce the reliance on a single vendor, which can be a source of single point of failure. Reliance on a single vendor was a factor in this incident and the other routing crashes we experienced, as the software on the edge routers is from a single vendor. By diversifying vendors, the likelihood of a similar failure in the future is significantly reduced, ensuring the stability and reliability of the network for years to come.\n\n‌\n\nIn Conclusion\nDigitalOcean recognizes and understands how disruptive networking incidents are to our customers and that repeated networking outages erode customer trust, as well as lead to business impact for our users. We let our users down and are working to earn customer trust back by taking steps to improve our networking stack as a whole, as well as reduce single points of failure in our networking vendor and in DigitalOcean internal services.\n\n‌\n\nWe’re committed to being as transparent as possible as networking upgrades happen and will communicate with users to ensure they can plan appropriately. We are also reviewing all deployment processes at DigitalOcean to ensure sufficient testing is done before any production change. DigitalOcean is confident in our commitment to excellence and that the future measures we’ve identified will drive better and better outcomes for our users.\n\nMar 07, 2023 - 22:11 UTC\n\n-\n\nResolved\nAs of 10:00 UTC, our Engineering team has resolved the issue with the Cloud Control panel, services in the NYC3 region, Functions, Container registry, and Event processing in all the regions should now be operating normally.
