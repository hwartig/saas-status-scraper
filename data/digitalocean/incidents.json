The list of known impacted AWS client tools are:\nAWS CLI v2.23.0 (workaround - move to last known good version: v2.22.35)\nAWS SDK for Python (boto3) v1.36.0 (workaround - move to last known good version: 1.35.99)\nAWS SDK for Go 2025-01-15 release (workaround - move to last known good release: 2025-01-14)",

          "body": "# Postmortem\n\nWe post updates on incidents regularly to cover the details of our findings, learnings and corresponding actions to prevent recurrence. For this update, we will cover a recent incident related to network maintenance. Maintenance is an essential part of ensuring service stability at DigitalOcean, through scheduled upgrades, patches, and more. We work hard to plan for no interruptions from maintenance activities and we recognize the impact that maintenance can have on our customers if there is downtime. We apologize for the disruption that occurred and have identified action items to ensure maintenance activities are planned with minimal downtime and that we have plans to minimize impact, even when unforeseen errors occur. We go into detail about this below.\n\n## **Incident Summary**\n\nOn Jan. 7, 2025 12:10 UTC, DigitalOcean experienced a loss of network connectivity for Regional External Load Balancers, DOKS, and AppPlatform products in the SFO3 region. This impact was the result of an unexpected effect of scheduled maintenance work to upgrade our infrastructure and enhance network performance. The maintenance work to complete the network change was designed to be seamless, with the worst expected case being dropped packets. The resolution rollout began Jan. 7th at 13:15 UTC and was fully completed with all services reported operational Jan. 7th at 14:30 UTC.\n\n## **Incident Details**\n\nThe DigitalOcean Networking team started performing scheduled maintenance to enhance network performance at 10:00 UTC. As part of this maintenance, a routing change was rolled out at 12:10 UTC that would redirect the traffic over to a new path in the datacenter. There was an old routing configuration present on the Core switches that did not get updated. This resulted in traffic being dropped for products relying on Regional External Load Balancers \\(e.g. Droplets, DOKS, AppPlatform\\). As soon as we detected the drop in traffic, we reverted the changes to mitigate the impact. \n\n## **Timeline of Events**\n\n12:12 UTC - Flip to the new workflow was started and the impact began \n\n12:40 UTC - Alert fired for Load Balancers\n\n13:00 UTC - First report from customers was received\n\n13:13 UTC - Revert of the new code was started\n\n13:21 UTC - Incident was spun up\n\n14:19 UTC - Routing configuration was updated on Core Switches \n\n14:30 UTC - Code revert was completed and service functionality was restored\n\n## **Remediation Actions**\n\nFollowing a full internal postmortem, DigitalOcean engineers identified several areas of learning to prevent similar incidents. These include updating maintenance processes, increasing monitoring and alerting, and improving observability of network services. \n\nKey Learnings:\n\n1. Learning: Gaps in our automated validation of Network configuration setup for the rollout of this enhancement were identified. While our new, upgraded network results in a simpler state, we have inherited interim complexity as we transition from old to new.\n\n* Actions: The gaps in validation automation that resulted in this incident have been addressed. In addition, automated audit processes to further harden the validation process across all network configurations will be applied.\n\n‌\n\n1. Learning: Gaps in our incremental rollout process for network datapath changes for both pre- and post-deployment were identified. The process for these changes allowed for quicker rollouts for small changes that passed validation. We recognize that \"small changes\" can have a high impact.\n\n* Actions: All network changes will follow an incremental rollout plan, regardless of whether or not validation processes determine that it is a minor change. Runbooks have been updated with reachability tests to encompass Load Balancers and Kubernetes clusters for this type of maintenance. Additional testing steps in both pre-maintenance and post-maintenance procedures to confirm the success of the maintenance have also been implemented.",

The change made at 22:38 UTC \\(5:38:40PM ET\\) added an Extensible Provisioning Protocol \\(EPP\\) [clientHold](https://icann.org/epp#clientHold) status code to our domain.\n\nThe code prevents DNS resolution until a customer contacts Network Solutions to clear the hold. The impact of the hold resulted in DigitalOcean customers being unable to sign-up/log-in via the Cloud Control Panel at the beginning of the incident and experiencing errors with Spaces buckets and dependent services, such as DigitalOcean Container Registry, App Platform, Functions, Load Balancers, and Mongo Managed Database Backups for the duration of the incident. \n\n# Incident Summary\n\n**Root Cause:** Domain registrar erroneously placed a clientHold on the [digitaloceanspaces.com](http://digitaloceanspaces.com) domain, impacting DNS resolution and causing an outage.\n\n**Impact:** Traffic to DigitalOcean products \\(e.g. Cloud Control Panel, Spaces, App Platform, etc.\\) began to see intermittent failures between 11/28 22:38 UTC and 04:03 UTC, with the worst failures happening between 03:00 and 04:03 UTC as DNS cache and TTLs began expiring.\n\n**Response:** DigitalOcean escalated to the domain registrar, as well as Verisign \\(as the authoritative domain registry for .com domains\\), to have the clientHold removed. \n\n# Timeline of Events\n\nNovember 28, 2024 \\(UTC\\)\n\n* 22:38 - Incident declared based on monitoring and customer reports of our Cloud Control Panel not loading.\n* 22:44 -  Issue detected by an internal alert\n* 22:57 - 1st customer contact regarding Cloud Control Panel impact\n* 23:57 - We noticed that our whois information for the domain had been updated on November 28 22:38 UTC.\n\nNovember 29, 2024 \\(UTC\\)\n\n* 01:06 - We identified the clientHold status in the EPP section of our whois for [digitaloceanspaces.com](http://digitaloceanspaces.com) and confirmed in our Network Solutions account that the domain had been marked inactive.\n* 01:08 - We initiated contact with Network Solutions to have the clientHold removed.\n* 01:30 - Reached out to Verisign executives to assistance \n* 01:42 - **Cloud Control Panel functionality restored**. \n* 02:40 - Conference call with Verisign executive to brief them on the issue\\(s\\) we have encountered attempting to resolve the clientHold status.\n* 02:44 - Email chain established with Verisign executives. A recap of all work done, problems, and a clear issue resolution request were sent.\n* 02:44 - 04:03 - Multiple escalations between Verisign executives leading to clientHold being removed.\n* 03:00 - As DNS caches and recursive DNS server TTLs began to expire, we saw the most severe service disruptions to our customers until resolution\n* 04:03 - clientHold removed from domain\n* 04:03 - 5:38:40 - Monitoring all infrastructure to ensure healthy and full recovery. **DigitalOcean functionality fully restored.**\n\n# Remediation Actions\n\nDigitalOcean teams are working on multiple types of remediation to prevent a similar incident from happening.\n\nDigitalOcean is working with Network Solutions to understand what happened on their end that resulted in the clientHold being applied to our domain incorrectly.\n\nIn addition, we are reviewing other domain registrars as possible new homes for our domains.\n\nTeams are also reviewing our monitoring and alerting to reduce our time to detect incidents related to registrar imposed changes and/or DNS resolution.",

Due to a majority of the line cards rebooting at the same time on one of our core routers in SFO3, an inter-regional traffic interruption and traffic drop to the network backbone occurred. This issue impacted users of any DigitalOcean services in the SFO3 region, with a longer impact on select Managed Kubernetes Clusters \\(DOKS\\). \n\n‌\n\n## **Incident Details**\n\n_Networking_\n\n* **Root Cause**: Several line cards rebooted at the same time on one of the core routers, due to hardware errors on the network device.\n* **Impact**: Datacenter traffic capacity to/from the backbone was reduced by half during this incident. Network connectivity to some DigitalOcean services was affected.\n* **Response**: All of the crashed line cards came online quickly, allowing network traffic to begin flowing again and the core router to become operational.\n\n_Specific Impact on DOKS_\n\n* **Root Cause:** Due to the network issues from line card reboots, a number of DOKS fleet machines became unhealthy as guest networking failed to recover from the hardware fault.\n* **Impact:** Some customer clusters experienced connectivity issues and difficulty in accessing the K8s control plane until networking for the underlying nodes was restored.\n* **Response:** All affected nodes across the SFO3 region in the DOKS fleet were recycled.\n\n## **Timeline of Events**\n\nSep 25 22:21 - Large majority of line cards rebooted on the core router.\n\nSep 25 22:24 - Line cards became online.\n\nSep 25 22:25 - Network protocols started session establishment process.\n\nSep 25 22:30 - Traffic on the affected core router was restored.\n\nSep 25 22:50 - SFO3 control plane systems all reconnected and recovered. \n\nSep 25 23:07 - DOKS API servers degraded.\n\nSep 25 23:59 - Some DOKS clusters in the SFO3 region could not be scraped. Several nodes were discovered to be in a “not ready” state.\n\nSep 26 01:40 - All impacted DOKS nodes recycled and clusters are operational. \n\n## **Remediation Actions**\n\nDigitalOcean teams are working on multiple types of remediation to help prevent a similar incident from happening in the future. \n\nDigitalOcean is working with the vendor support team for the devices to determine the root cause of the line card crash, as well as upgrading software on the core routers in the SFO3 region.. \n\nDuring the incident, engineers had to manually remediate affected nodes across the entire SFO3 DOKS fleet to restore service. Teams are exploring methods to reduce the need for manual action in the future, by increasing thresholds for automated remediation actions, such that service is restored as quickly as possible.",
