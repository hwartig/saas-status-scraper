Organizations using Bitbucket are now able to build successfully following mitigation actions we implemented earlier today.\n\nWhat happened: We identified an issue where retrieving user identities from Bitbucket was encountering rate limiting for accounts with extensive project configurations. This was caused by recent changes to Bitbucket's rate limiting behavior that were enforced in late December 2025. Our mitigating actions helped resolve the issue for most of the affected organizations.\n\nCurrent status: Organizations that were previously unable to build are now building successfully. A small number of individual users with access to very large numbers of repositories may still occasionally encounter rate limiting by Bitbucket during the identity retrieval process. These users can have another team member trigger builds as a workaround.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues: Please reach out to us via your regular support channels.",

          "body": "## Summary\n\n_All timestamps are in UTC_\n\nOn December 2, 2025, at 16:20, we deployed a code change to workflow status computation that introduced a race condition in how workflows are terminated. This caused the following impacts:\n\n**Duplicated auto-rerun workflows \\(Dec 2, 16:20 - Dec 3, 14:20\\):** Some customers using auto-rerun experienced duplicate workflows being created and duplicate email notifications.\n\n**API and UI degradation \\(Dec 3, 12:10 - 22:50\\):** Some customers experienced issues with the Workflows API and errors in the UI when trying to view pipelines.\n\n**Job execution delays \\(Dec 3, 16:20 - 16:32\\):** Several customers experienced delays in job execution, with some jobs failing to start or becoming stuck.\n\nThe incident was fully resolved on **December 3 at 22:50.**\n\nWe thank our customers for their patience and understanding as we worked to resolve this incident.\n\nThis incident tracked as multiple separate issues and status pages:\n\n* Pipelines page not loading \\([Link 1](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/21cysyp8d333), [Link 2](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/fjpg0vmh476k)\\)\n* Jobs stuck in running state \\([Link](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/kvzp8x242n34)\\)\n* Jobs not starting \\([Link](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/jq4bgq2sjt1r)\\)\n\n## What Happened\n\nOn December 2, 2025, at 16:20, we deployed a code change that introduced a race condition in how workflows are terminated. When workflows failed with concurrent jobs terminating, our system published duplicate workflow completion events. For some customers with auto-rerun enabled, these duplicate events triggered duplicate workflows to be created, causing cascading issues across our platform.\n\n_**Initial Detection and Response \\(Dec 2, 21:40 - Dec 3, 14:20\\)**_\n\nAt 21:40 on December 2nd, we received the first customer report of excessive workflow executions. Our notifications team was also alerted to a high number of notifications being sent. We initially thought it was an isolated issue related to customer automation, so we flagged the affected project at 21:46 and saw recovery on the notifications side.\n\nAt 21:51 we learned that a different customer reported duplicate workflow failure emails. We suspected it might be related to a recent feature rollout, but investigation did not identify a root cause. We initially thought the elevated rate of messages from the first customer somehow impacted other customers. By 22:19, no other customer had reported similar issues and metrics were back to normal, so we decided to continue the investigation the next day.\n\nAt 9:55 on December 3rd, we received alerts to elevated notifications and we resumed investigation. We escalated to a full incident at 13:44. We learned that the notifications issues seemed to be caused by auto-reruns, so we disabled auto-rerun system-wide at 13:56. We identified and rolled back the problematic code change at 14:15, then re-enabled auto-rerun at 14:20.\n\nThis resolved the primary issue of duplicate workflows and notifications being created.\n\n38 projects were impacted by the auto-rerun issue with a total of 33,135 duplicate workflows created. It also led to duplicate email notifications for 18 organizations.\n\nBecause the issue manifested across multiple domains \\(Orchestration, Notifications, API/UI, and Execution\\), we initially investigated these as separate incidents. It took time to correlate these incidents back to a single root cause. However, this fix did not immediately resolve all customer-facing issues due to downstream impacts.\n\n### **Downstream Impact**\n\nThe excessive workflows caused cascading issues across our platform:\n\n_**Notification Issues \\(Dec 2, 21:40 - Dec 3, 14:20\\)**_  \n18 organizations received duplicate email notifications for workflow failures.\n\n_**API and UI Issues \\(Dec 3, 12:10 - 22:50\\)**_  \nAt 11:54, our monitoring detected a service queue growing due to duplicate events. While investigating, we discovered the Pipelines page was struggling to load starting at 12:10. The issue was intermittent and was initially resolved at 15:11. However, at 15:30 API errors returned and we continued to investigate.\n\nAt 21:30 we identified that some pipelines had over 10,000 workflows, causing our APIs to slow down and fail. Affected customers experienced failed requests to the Workflows API and errors when trying to view pipelines. We deployed targeted fixes between 22:16 and 22:50 that filtered out problematic pipelines, restoring API performance.\n\n_**Job Execution Delays \\(Dec 3, 16:20 - 16:32\\)**_\n\nAt 16:18, our monitoring alerted us to issues with our job orchestration system. While investigating, we identified a drop in jobs being processed. At 16:20, our job execution infrastructure began experiencing memory pressure due to increased API traffic from the duplicate workflows. This memory pressure disrupted normal job processing and cancellation handling, and caused services to restart. Job processing recovered at 16:32. During this window, approximately 3,500 jobs were delayed, and 1,100 jobs \\(3% of tasks\\) failed to start. Additionally, 8,000 jobs became stuck in a canceling state. We then scaled our execution infrastructure to prevent further memory pressure.\n\nWe later identified that this execution impact was connected to the API issues described above, demonstrating the cascading nature of the incident across multiple systems.\n\n### **Resolution**\n\nAll systems fully recovered by 22:50 UTC on December 3rd. We have refunded credits consumed by duplicate workflows for all 38 impacted projects on December 5th.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement\n\nWe're taking several actions to prevent similar incidents and improve our detection and response:\n\n**Preventing Duplicate Workflows**\n\nWe're putting safeguards in place to prevent race conditions when workflows are terminated and we're also adding constraints to prevent duplicate auto-rerun workflows from being created in the first place.\n\n**Improved Monitoring and Alerting**\n\nWhile we have monitors in place, we didn't get paged for some of the issues, which delayed our incident response. As a result, we've updated existing monitoring alerts to page on-call engineers for execution infrastructure API errors and service restarts, and we're adding new alerts for UI-related issues.\n\n**Better System Resilience**\n\nWe will be updating the Pipelines page to handle large numbers of workflows more gracefully while also looking to understand and improve how our systems behave under pressure.\n\n**Incident Response**\n\nOne of the key challenges in this incident was the difficulty in correlating that these incidents all came from the same root cause. As a result we're taking the following actions:\n\n* Establishing better communication protocols to quickly correlate related incidents across teams\n* Improving coordination when mitigations in one system may impact downstream services",

          "body": "## Summary\n\n_All timestamps are in UTC_\n\nOn December 2, 2025, at 16:20, we deployed a code change to workflow status computation that introduced a race condition in how workflows are terminated. This caused the following impacts:\n\n**Duplicated auto-rerun workflows \\(Dec 2, 16:20 - Dec 3, 14:20\\):** Some customers using auto-rerun experienced duplicate workflows being created and duplicate email notifications.\n\n**API and UI degradation \\(Dec 3, 12:10 - 22:50\\):** Some customers experienced issues with the Workflows API and errors in the UI when trying to view pipelines.\n\n**Job execution delays \\(Dec 3, 16:20 - 16:32\\):** Several customers experienced delays in job execution, with some jobs failing to start or becoming stuck.\n\nThe incident was fully resolved on **December 3 at 22:50.**\n\nWe thank our customers for their patience and understanding as we worked to resolve this incident.\n\nThis incident tracked as multiple separate issues and status pages:\n\n* Pipelines page not loading \\([Link 1](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/21cysyp8d333), [Link 2](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/fjpg0vmh476k)\\)\n* Jobs stuck in running state \\([Link](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/kvzp8x242n34)\\)\n* Jobs not starting \\([Link](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/jq4bgq2sjt1r)\\)\n\n## What Happened\n\nOn December 2, 2025, at 16:20, we deployed a code change that introduced a race condition in how workflows are terminated. When workflows failed with concurrent jobs terminating, our system published duplicate workflow completion events. For some customers with auto-rerun enabled, these duplicate events triggered duplicate workflows to be created, causing cascading issues across our platform.\n\n_**Initial Detection and Response \\(Dec 2, 21:40 - Dec 3, 14:20\\)**_\n\nAt 21:40 on December 2nd, we received the first customer report of excessive workflow executions. Our notifications team was also alerted to a high number of notifications being sent. We initially thought it was an isolated issue related to customer automation, so we flagged the affected project at 21:46 and saw recovery on the notifications side.\n\nAt 21:51 we learned that a different customer reported duplicate workflow failure emails. We suspected it might be related to a recent feature rollout, but investigation did not identify a root cause. We initially thought the elevated rate of messages from the first customer somehow impacted other customers. By 22:19, no other customer had reported similar issues and metrics were back to normal, so we decided to continue the investigation the next day.\n\nAt 9:55 on December 3rd, we received alerts to elevated notifications and we resumed investigation. We escalated to a full incident at 13:44. We learned that the notifications issues seemed to be caused by auto-reruns, so we disabled auto-rerun system-wide at 13:56. We identified and rolled back the problematic code change at 14:15, then re-enabled auto-rerun at 14:20.\n\nThis resolved the primary issue of duplicate workflows and notifications being created.\n\n38 projects were impacted by the auto-rerun issue with a total of 33,135 duplicate workflows created. It also led to duplicate email notifications for 18 organizations.\n\nBecause the issue manifested across multiple domains \\(Orchestration, Notifications, API/UI, and Execution\\), we initially investigated these as separate incidents. It took time to correlate these incidents back to a single root cause. However, this fix did not immediately resolve all customer-facing issues due to downstream impacts.\n\n### **Downstream Impact**\n\nThe excessive workflows caused cascading issues across our platform:\n\n_**Notification Issues \\(Dec 2, 21:40 - Dec 3, 14:20\\)**_  \n18 organizations received duplicate email notifications for workflow failures.\n\n_**API and UI Issues \\(Dec 3, 12:10 - 22:50\\)**_  \nAt 11:54, our monitoring detected a service queue growing due to duplicate events. While investigating, we discovered the Pipelines page was struggling to load starting at 12:10. The issue was intermittent and was initially resolved at 15:11. However, at 15:30 API errors returned and we continued to investigate.\n\nAt 21:30 we identified that some pipelines had over 10,000 workflows, causing our APIs to slow down and fail. Affected customers experienced failed requests to the Workflows API and errors when trying to view pipelines. We deployed targeted fixes between 22:16 and 22:50 that filtered out problematic pipelines, restoring API performance.\n\n_**Job Execution Delays \\(Dec 3, 16:20 - 16:32\\)**_\n\nAt 16:18, our monitoring alerted us to issues with our job orchestration system. While investigating, we identified a drop in jobs being processed. At 16:20, our job execution infrastructure began experiencing memory pressure due to increased API traffic from the duplicate workflows. This memory pressure disrupted normal job processing and cancellation handling, and caused services to restart. Job processing recovered at 16:32. During this window, approximately 3,500 jobs were delayed, and 1,100 jobs \\(3% of tasks\\) failed to start. Additionally, 8,000 jobs became stuck in a canceling state. We then scaled our execution infrastructure to prevent further memory pressure.\n\nWe later identified that this execution impact was connected to the API issues described above, demonstrating the cascading nature of the incident across multiple systems.\n\n### **Resolution**\n\nAll systems fully recovered by 22:50 UTC on December 3rd. We have refunded credits consumed by duplicate workflows for all 38 impacted projects on December 5th.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement\n\nWe're taking several actions to prevent similar incidents and improve our detection and response:\n\n**Preventing Duplicate Workflows**\n\nWe're putting safeguards in place to prevent race conditions when workflows are terminated and we're also adding constraints to prevent duplicate auto-rerun workflows from being created in the first place.\n\n**Improved Monitoring and Alerting**\n\nWhile we have monitors in place, we didn't get paged for some of the issues, which delayed our incident response. As a result, we've updated existing monitoring alerts to page on-call engineers for execution infrastructure API errors and service restarts, and we're adding new alerts for UI-related issues.\n\n**Better System Resilience**\n\nWe will be updating the Pipelines page to handle large numbers of workflows more gracefully while also looking to understand and improve how our systems behave under pressure.\n\n**Incident Response**\n\nOne of the key challenges in this incident was the difficulty in correlating that these incidents all came from the same root cause. As a result we're taking the following actions:\n\n* Establishing better communication protocols to quickly correlate related incidents across teams\n* Improving coordination when mitigations in one system may impact downstream services",

          "body": "## Summary\n\n_All timestamps are in UTC_\n\nOn December 2, 2025, at 16:20, we deployed a code change to workflow status computation that introduced a race condition in how workflows are terminated. This caused the following impacts:\n\n**Duplicated auto-rerun workflows \\(Dec 2, 16:20 - Dec 3, 14:20\\):** Some customers using auto-rerun experienced duplicate workflows being created and duplicate email notifications.\n\n**API and UI degradation \\(Dec 3, 12:10 - 22:50\\):** Some customers experienced issues with the Workflows API and errors in the UI when trying to view pipelines.\n\n**Job execution delays \\(Dec 3, 16:20 - 16:32\\):** Several customers experienced delays in job execution, with some jobs failing to start or becoming stuck.\n\nThe incident was fully resolved on **December 3 at 22:50.**\n\nWe thank our customers for their patience and understanding as we worked to resolve this incident.\n\nThis incident tracked as multiple separate issues and status pages:\n\n* Pipelines page not loading \\([Link 1](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/21cysyp8d333), [Link 2](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/fjpg0vmh476k)\\)\n* Jobs stuck in running state \\([Link](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/kvzp8x242n34)\\)\n* Jobs not starting \\([Link](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/jq4bgq2sjt1r)\\)\n\n## What Happened\n\nOn December 2, 2025, at 16:20, we deployed a code change that introduced a race condition in how workflows are terminated. When workflows failed with concurrent jobs terminating, our system published duplicate workflow completion events. For some customers with auto-rerun enabled, these duplicate events triggered duplicate workflows to be created, causing cascading issues across our platform.\n\n_**Initial Detection and Response \\(Dec 2, 21:40 - Dec 3, 14:20\\)**_\n\nAt 21:40 on December 2nd, we received the first customer report of excessive workflow executions. Our notifications team was also alerted to a high number of notifications being sent. We initially thought it was an isolated issue related to customer automation, so we flagged the affected project at 21:46 and saw recovery on the notifications side.\n\nAt 21:51 we learned that a different customer reported duplicate workflow failure emails. We suspected it might be related to a recent feature rollout, but investigation did not identify a root cause. We initially thought the elevated rate of messages from the first customer somehow impacted other customers. By 22:19, no other customer had reported similar issues and metrics were back to normal, so we decided to continue the investigation the next day.\n\nAt 9:55 on December 3rd, we received alerts to elevated notifications and we resumed investigation. We escalated to a full incident at 13:44. We learned that the notifications issues seemed to be caused by auto-reruns, so we disabled auto-rerun system-wide at 13:56. We identified and rolled back the problematic code change at 14:15, then re-enabled auto-rerun at 14:20.\n\nThis resolved the primary issue of duplicate workflows and notifications being created.\n\n38 projects were impacted by the auto-rerun issue with a total of 33,135 duplicate workflows created. It also led to duplicate email notifications for 18 organizations.\n\nBecause the issue manifested across multiple domains \\(Orchestration, Notifications, API/UI, and Execution\\), we initially investigated these as separate incidents. It took time to correlate these incidents back to a single root cause. However, this fix did not immediately resolve all customer-facing issues due to downstream impacts.\n\n### **Downstream Impact**\n\nThe excessive workflows caused cascading issues across our platform:\n\n_**Notification Issues \\(Dec 2, 21:40 - Dec 3, 14:20\\)**_  \n18 organizations received duplicate email notifications for workflow failures.\n\n_**API and UI Issues \\(Dec 3, 12:10 - 22:50\\)**_  \nAt 11:54, our monitoring detected a service queue growing due to duplicate events. While investigating, we discovered the Pipelines page was struggling to load starting at 12:10. The issue was intermittent and was initially resolved at 15:11. However, at 15:30 API errors returned and we continued to investigate.\n\nAt 21:30 we identified that some pipelines had over 10,000 workflows, causing our APIs to slow down and fail. Affected customers experienced failed requests to the Workflows API and errors when trying to view pipelines. We deployed targeted fixes between 22:16 and 22:50 that filtered out problematic pipelines, restoring API performance.\n\n_**Job Execution Delays \\(Dec 3, 16:20 - 16:32\\)**_\n\nAt 16:18, our monitoring alerted us to issues with our job orchestration system. While investigating, we identified a drop in jobs being processed. At 16:20, our job execution infrastructure began experiencing memory pressure due to increased API traffic from the duplicate workflows. This memory pressure disrupted normal job processing and cancellation handling, and caused services to restart. Job processing recovered at 16:32. During this window, approximately 3,500 jobs were delayed, and 1,100 jobs \\(3% of tasks\\) failed to start. Additionally, 8,000 jobs became stuck in a canceling state. We then scaled our execution infrastructure to prevent further memory pressure.\n\nWe later identified that this execution impact was connected to the API issues described above, demonstrating the cascading nature of the incident across multiple systems.\n\n### **Resolution**\n\nAll systems fully recovered by 22:50 UTC on December 3rd. We have refunded credits consumed by duplicate workflows for all 38 impacted projects on December 5th.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement\n\nWe're taking several actions to prevent similar incidents and improve our detection and response:\n\n**Preventing Duplicate Workflows**\n\nWe're putting safeguards in place to prevent race conditions when workflows are terminated and we're also adding constraints to prevent duplicate auto-rerun workflows from being created in the first place.\n\n**Improved Monitoring and Alerting**\n\nWhile we have monitors in place, we didn't get paged for some of the issues, which delayed our incident response. As a result, we've updated existing monitoring alerts to page on-call engineers for execution infrastructure API errors and service restarts, and we're adding new alerts for UI-related issues.\n\n**Better System Resilience**\n\nWe will be updating the Pipelines page to handle large numbers of workflows more gracefully while also looking to understand and improve how our systems behave under pressure.\n\n**Incident Response**\n\nOne of the key challenges in this incident was the difficulty in correlating that these incidents all came from the same root cause. As a result we're taking the following actions:\n\n* Establishing better communication protocols to quickly correlate related incidents across teams\n* Improving coordination when mitigations in one system may impact downstream services",

          "body": "## Summary\n\nOn October 20, 2025, from 06:55 to 22:00 UTC, CircleCI customers experienced a variety of failures and delays across the system including job failures, pipeline creation failures, periods of increased queueing, errors in the UI and APIs, and a period of unavailability for audit log streaming failures due to an AWS outage affecting multiple AWS services in the US-EAST-1 region. We want to thank our customers for your patience and understanding as we worked to resolve this incident.\n\nThe original status page for this incident can be found [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/0y7q12npsl4h).\n\n## What Happened\n\n\\(All times UTC\\)\n\nOn October 20, 2025 at 06:55 the system that handles requests to create new pipelines \\(builds service\\) began to receive `503 Service Unavailable` error responses when attempting to retrieve pipeline values from AWS S3, resulting in failures and delays across multiple executor types.\n\nAt 07:11, [AWS declared an incident](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status?eventID=arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/MULTIPLE_SERVICES/AWS_MULTIPLE_SERVICES_OPERATIONAL_ISSUE/AWS_MULTIPLE_SERVICES_OPERATIONAL_ISSUE_BA540_514A652BE1A) indicating that multiple AWS services were experiencing increased error rates and latencies in the US-EAST-1 region. During the same time, CircleCI customers began experiencing premature failures on running jobs across multiple executors. Audit log access and streaming was also unavailable at this time. CircleCI declared an incident at 07:29.\n\nAt 07:40, builds service started to encounter errors when attempting to read and write from S3. This resulted in errors loading the pipelines page in the CircleCI UI as well as errors creating pipelines. At the same time, the service responsible for starting workflows also encountered issues accessing S3, resulting in some jobs being dropped. Pipeline creation slowly began to recover at 08:24, and completely recovered by 09:14 along with workflow runs. During this time, Docker, Mac M1 and M4, Windows, and Android jobs began to run again. Linux, Remote Docker, and Mac M2 jobs continued to queue.\n\nAt 09:30, the system responsible for provisioning machines was unable to start new instances in AWS EC2 to meet the growing backlog of customer jobs. AWS acknowledged the increase in error rates when launching EC2 instances at 10:35. Docker jobs continued to run, but customers experienced high queue times as demand grew.\n\nBy 12:20, the queue time for Docker jobs dropped to 18 minutes from a previous high of 50 minutes. The queue of Docker jobs continued to shrink and eventually clear by 14:00. At 14:30, CircleCI engineers made a change to prevent infrastructure responsible for processing Docker jobs from scaling down and releasing instances, as EC2 was still experiencing provisioning failures.\n\nAt 15:28, Mac M4 machines became temporarily unavailable because our connectivity to the Mac environment relies on AWS networking. As network stability improved, Mac workloads were able to resume.\n\nAt 17:10, machine jobs \\(Linux, Remote Docker, Mac M1 and M2\\) began starting again after AWS applied a fix to EC2.\n\nAt 17:30, Mac M4 machines began to successfully boot again after AWS applied fixes to the network load balancers. At the same time, CircleCI’s task queue hit its peak and began to decrease as AWS service health continued to improve.\n\nThe backlog of jobs that had built up during the incident continued to clear over the next few hours. By 22:00, all customer jobs in the backlog had been processed, and new incoming jobs were being processed at pre-incident rates.\n\nWe continued to monitor our systems, and the CircleCI incident was marked resolved at 22:15.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement\n\nWhile outages of this scale are rare, we are strengthening both our resilience and the experience our customers have during major upstream disruptions.\n\nDuring this incident, we evaluated options to shift workloads to backup compute providers and different AWS regions. Based on the errors we were observing across multiple AWS services as well as instability in several upstream dependencies also impacted by the outage, we did not have confidence that shifting workloads would improve the situation. There was a significant risk of introducing new failures without reducing the disruption customers were already experiencing. In addition, based on the duration and scope of similar AWS incidents in the past, it was unlikely that shifting workloads mid-incident would restore service faster than AWS could complete their recovery. As a result, jobs continued to queue and then ran as expected once AWS restored stability.\n\nAdditionally, in the event of an AWS incident anticipated to span multiple days or longer, we would initiate disaster recovery to a different region. However, in this particular case, we had information from AWS indicating that the service would be restored in a timeframe where waiting was the best approach for our customers.\n\nIn order to ensure that our customers have the information they need to make timely decisions, we are also investing in improving our status page communication during major incidents. These improvements include:\n\n* Clearer visibility into which CircleCI functionality is impacted at any point in time.\n* More frequent updates based on our own service health, not only upstream reports.\n* Better expectations for how jobs will behave during disruptions.\n\nOur goal is to improve transparency, recovery options, and the predictability of the customer experience when the unexpected happens.",
