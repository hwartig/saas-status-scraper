          "body": "## Incident Report: 2023-03-14 - Delays Starting Jobs\n\n## Summary:\n\nOn March 14, 2023, at approximately 18:00 UTC, all customers' pipelines began to experience delays in starting, ultimately resulting in jobs not running. This incident lasted until approximately 01:27 UTC. In short, an ongoing Kubernetes upgrade created a version mismatch between kubelet and kubeproxy, leading to widespread networking failures in our main production cluster. The remediation efforts for this incident also led to two incidents caused by errors in our queuing system using RabbitMQ queues and nodes, from 02:50 to 05:14 UTC, where all customer pipelines experienced delays, and from 09:50 to 13:15 UTC where GitHub checks were delayed by as much as 30 minutes.\n\nThe original status page updates can be found here: [Jobs not starting](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/dcqb3fykhgvg), [Jobs not starting cont'd](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/9c9nq4p6wx3x) and [GitHub Checks are delayed](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/h86y8k0ypthl).\n\nWe want to thank our customers for your patience and understanding as we worked to resolve this incident.\n\n## What Happened\n\nIn the week prior to this event, our infrastructure team had been slowly carrying out an upgrade of our main production Kubernetes cluster. On March 13th, 2023, after updating a few components, some services started reporting missing metrics. We proceeded to revert the changes and things seemingly recovered as the metrics came back. After reviewing and adjusting the plan to limit the blast radius, at approximately 17:40 UTC on March 14th, we attempted a different approach to upgrading these components. At 18:00 UTC, we started seeing an increase in communication errors on one of our services. As more engineers and teams joined the incident call, we could see that we were facing a much more widespread impact throughout multiple services and on all functionalities of the application. As the delays in job processing continued to climb and as our job queues started backing up across multiple services, we restarted a few services in an attempt to mitigate some of the symptoms we were seeing. Soon, it became clear that the issues were stemming from failures in service-to-service communication, and within an hour, the initial degraded state of the application became a significant incident.\n\nAfter continued investigation, digging through logs, metrics, and attempts to connect to services using internal Kubernetes domain names directly from the pods, we suspected that the networking issues leading to communication failures were either due to `kube-proxy`, `core-dns` or `node-local-dns-cache`. This was difficult to verify, as all of those workloads appeared to be healthy.\n\nBetween 20:00 and 21:00 UTC, we decided to restart node-local-dns-cache and core-dns, which caused DNS resolution to fail completely. The team was starting to hone in on `kube-proxy` as the main culprit and the restart of one of the nodes gave us more confidence as we noticed that requests related to that node were going through. At this point, we continued on the restart path and restarted every node. By 23:00, all the nodes were rolled out and we had started seeing recovery except for those jobs using contexts or machine executor. We then restarted a separate pool of dependencies and by 01:15 UTC, March 15th, all jobs were executing correctly.\n\nDuring recovery, we identified that were missing logging for RabbitMQ, so to complete our mitigation efforts, we rolled the rest of our infrastructure. At approximately 02:50 UTC RabbitMQ connection errors led to another episode of delayed jobs that we were able to mitigate by 03:35 UTC. This second incident was fully resolved by 05:14 UTC.\n\nA subsequent restart of the RabbitMQ nodes was carried out to fix a few corrupted queues that caused another degradation in GitHub checks at 09:50 UTC, March 15th. We mitigated the issue by 11:08 UTC and after a long period of monitoring the situation, the incident was fully resolved at 13:15 UTC.\n\n## Post Incident Contributing Events Analysis:\n\nDue to the broad impact of the networking issues, a complete restart of the cluster was ultimately needed to mitigate this issue. At the time of mitigation, it was evident that something in our Kubernetes upgrade process was responsible for this networking failure and further analysis was needed to see what we missed. Upon review, we identified that at the onset of the incident, `kube-proxy`, a network proxy running on every `node` in the Kubernetes cluster had a spike of \"Sync failed\" errors.\n\n```shell\n\"Failed to execute iptables-restore\" err=\"exit status 1 (iptables-restore: line 8022 failed\\n)\"\n\"Sync failed\" retryingTime=\"30s\"\n```\n\nTo understand what’s happening here, it’s important to understand the role of `Kube-proxy` in a cluster. `Pods` \\(smallest deployable units\\) in a cluster have a temporary life cycle. They are ephemeral by nature and are terminated or created as required. Usually, each pod is running a single instance of an application. They are able to reach each other using unique IP addresses that are assigned to them. These IP addresses can change without warning in response to events such as scaling or failures. A set of pods in a cluster are load-balanced by a `Service` object. Services are also assigned a virtual IP address and leverage an `Endpoints` object to keep track of what pods are available at any given time. `Kube-proxy`, as noted above, runs on each node of the cluster and watches the `Service` and `Endpoints` objects. When changes occur in these objects, updates the routing rules on the host nodes are updated using `iptables` \\(the default execution mode for `kube-proxy`\\) a Linux firewall utility that allows or blocks traffic based on defined rules and policies. In a nutshell, `kube-proxy` consumes these `Endpoints` objects and modifies the local node's `iptables` to implement a local load balancer for each Service's virtual IP. As pods are created or destroyed in response to events, `kube-proxy` reconciles the rulesets on the node against the available `Endpoints`.\n\nIn the course of its normal operation `kube-proxy` performs a read/modify/write operation in the [Proxier.syncProxyRules\\(\\)](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/bc4763cbf8b9e6adfbc07bb3194509b187b0b901/pkg/proxy/iptables/proxier.go#L795) method. This method uses the system `iptables-save` and `iptables-restore` commands to read in the state, create new rules, and write the state back out. Between the two Kubernetes versions we were working with, the handling and format of `kube-proxy'`s rulesets changed.\n\nWhat we did not notice was when we rolled back the `kube-proxy` version on March 13th, a very small amount of `Sync-failure` errors started showing up in our logs as visible in the graph below.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/circleci/original/3X/9/a/9a1ba3057da89a317e7088dcb6fb2ffde2c8a4a9.jpeg)\nAs we rolled out more pods and existing `Endpoints` objects changed in response to these events, `kube-proxy`attempted to sync and reconcile the `iptables` on the nodes and failed to do so. These errors increased as more changes to pods and services were introduced during the upgrade process and on March 14th, as we resumed the upgrade, a spike in `sync errors` left the `iptables` on multiple nodes in a very corrupted state.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/circleci/original/3X/f/9/f95a209ec75979639a48fde4a1c25cbd67be6af3.jpeg)\nWhen we restarted the node, a fresh `iptable` ruleset was created and as we completed a full restart of the clusters, the sync errors disappeared restoring networking within the cluster.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement:\n\nAs we analyzed the contributing factors, we realized that there was not one single trigger that led to this incident. Due to the foundational nature of networking, Kubernetes upgrade are inherently risky and our risk mitigation strategies were not effective in the scenario where an interaction of multiple events ultimately triggered this incident. Our infrastructure engineering team is enhancing our Kubernetes upgrade process in order to significantly limit this risk model for future upgrades. In addition, we have enhanced observability with additional metrics and alerts specifically related to the sync errors being thrown by `kube-proxy` during the incident.\n\nAdditionally, we are evaluating strategies to improve the resilience of our RabbitMQ infrastructure.\n\nOnce again, we thank you for your patience as we worked to mitigate the incident and perform a thorough analysis of the events that caused this incident. Our goal remains to continue to improve the resilience and reliability of our application.",

This was difficult to verify, as all of those workloads appeared to be healthy.\n\nBetween 20:00 and 21:00 UTC, we decided to restart node-local-dns-cache and core-dns, which caused DNS resolution to fail completely. The team was starting to hone in on `kube-proxy` as the main culprit and the restart of one of the nodes gave us more confidence as we noticed that requests related to that node were going through. At this point, we continued on the restart path and restarted every node. By 23:00, all the nodes were rolled out and we had started seeing recovery except for those jobs using contexts or machine executor. We then restarted a separate pool of dependencies and by 01:15 UTC, March 15th, all jobs were executing correctly.\n\nDuring recovery, we identified that were missing logging for RabbitMQ, so to complete our mitigation efforts, we rolled the rest of our infrastructure. At approximately 02:50 UTC RabbitMQ connection errors led to another episode of delayed jobs that we were able to mitigate by 03:35 UTC. This second incident was fully resolved by 05:14 UTC.\n\nA subsequent restart of the RabbitMQ nodes was carried out to fix a few corrupted queues that caused another degradation in GitHub checks at 09:50 UTC, March 15th. We mitigated the issue by 11:08 UTC and after a long period of monitoring the situation, the incident was fully resolved at 13:15 UTC.\n\n## Post Incident Contributing Events Analysis:\n\nDue to the broad impact of the networking issues, a complete restart of the cluster was ultimately needed to mitigate this issue. At the time of mitigation, it was evident that something in our Kubernetes upgrade process was responsible for this networking failure and further analysis was needed to see what we missed. Upon review, we identified that at the onset of the incident, `kube-proxy`, a network proxy running on every `node` in the Kubernetes cluster had a spike of \"Sync failed\" errors.\n\n```shell\n\"Failed to execute iptables-restore\" err=\"exit status 1 (iptables-restore: line 8022 failed\\n)\"\n\"Sync failed\" retryingTime=\"30s\"\n```\n\nTo understand what’s happening here, it’s important to understand the role of `Kube-proxy` in a cluster. `Pods` \\(smallest deployable units\\) in a cluster have a temporary life cycle. They are ephemeral by nature and are terminated or created as required. Usually, each pod is running a single instance of an application. They are able to reach each other using unique IP addresses that are assigned to them. These IP addresses can change without warning in response to events such as scaling or failures. A set of pods in a cluster are load-balanced by a `Service` object. Services are also assigned a virtual IP address and leverage an `Endpoints` object to keep track of what pods are available at any given time. `Kube-proxy`, as noted above, runs on each node of the cluster and watches the `Service` and `Endpoints` objects. When changes occur in these objects, updates the routing rules on the host nodes are updated using `iptables` \\(the default execution mode for `kube-proxy`\\) a Linux firewall utility that allows or blocks traffic based on defined rules and policies. In a nutshell, `kube-proxy` consumes these `Endpoints` objects and modifies the local node's `iptables` to implement a local load balancer for each Service's virtual IP. As pods are created or destroyed in response to events, `kube-proxy` reconciles the rulesets on the node against the available `Endpoints`.\n\nIn the course of its normal operation `kube-proxy` performs a read/modify/write operation in the [Proxier.syncProxyRules\\(\\)](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/bc4763cbf8b9e6adfbc07bb3194509b187b0b901/pkg/proxy/iptables/proxier.go#L795) method. This method uses the system `iptables-save` and `iptables-restore` commands to read in the state, create new rules, and write the state back out. Between the two Kubernetes versions we were working with, the handling and format of `kube-proxy'`s rulesets changed.\n\nWhat we did not notice was when we rolled back the `kube-proxy` version on March 13th, a very small amount of `Sync-failure` errors started showing up in our logs as visible in the graph below.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/circleci/original/3X/9/a/9a1ba3057da89a317e7088dcb6fb2ffde2c8a4a9.jpeg)\nAs we rolled out more pods and existing `Endpoints` objects changed in response to these events, `kube-proxy`attempted to sync and reconcile the `iptables` on the nodes and failed to do so. These errors increased as more changes to pods and services were introduced during the upgrade process and on March 14th, as we resumed the upgrade, a spike in `sync errors` left the `iptables` on multiple nodes in a very corrupted state.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/circleci/original/3X/f/9/f95a209ec75979639a48fde4a1c25cbd67be6af3.jpeg)\nWhen we restarted the node, a fresh `iptable` ruleset was created and as we completed a full restart of the clusters, the sync errors disappeared restoring networking within the cluster.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement:\n\nAs we analyzed the contributing factors, we realized that there was not one single trigger that led to this incident. Due to the foundational nature of networking, Kubernetes upgrade are inherently risky and our risk mitigation strategies were not effective in the scenario where an interaction of multiple events ultimately triggered this incident. Our infrastructure engineering team is enhancing our Kubernetes upgrade process in order to significantly limit this risk model for future upgrades. In addition, we have enhanced observability with additional metrics and alerts specifically related to the sync errors being thrown by `kube-proxy` during the incident.\n\nAdditionally, we are evaluating strategies to improve the resilience of our RabbitMQ infrastructure.\n\nOnce again, we thank you for your patience as we worked to mitigate the incident and perform a thorough analysis of the events that caused this incident. Our goal remains to continue to improve the resilience and reliability of our application.",

          "body": "## Incident Report: 2023-03-14 - Delays Starting Jobs\n\n## Summary:\n\nOn March 14, 2023, at approximately 18:00 UTC, all customers' pipelines began to experience delays in starting, ultimately resulting in jobs not running. This incident lasted until approximately 01:27 UTC. In short, an ongoing Kubernetes upgrade created a version mismatch between kubelet and kubeproxy, leading to widespread networking failures in our main production cluster. The remediation efforts for this incident also led to two incidents caused by errors in our queuing system using RabbitMQ queues and nodes, from 02:50 to 05:14 UTC, where all customer pipelines experienced delays, and from 09:50 to 13:15 UTC where GitHub checks were delayed by as much as 30 minutes.\n\nThe original status page updates can be found here: [Jobs not starting](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/dcqb3fykhgvg), [Jobs not starting cont'd](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/9c9nq4p6wx3x) and [GitHub Checks are delayed](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/h86y8k0ypthl).\n\nWe want to thank our customers for your patience and understanding as we worked to resolve this incident.\n\n## What Happened\n\nIn the week prior to this event, our infrastructure team had been slowly carrying out an upgrade of our main production Kubernetes cluster. On March 13th, 2023, after updating a few components, some services started reporting missing metrics. We proceeded to revert the changes and things seemingly recovered as the metrics came back. After reviewing and adjusting the plan to limit the blast radius, at approximately 17:40 UTC on March 14th, we attempted a different approach to upgrading these components. At 18:00 UTC, we started seeing an increase in communication errors on one of our services. As more engineers and teams joined the incident call, we could see that we were facing a much more widespread impact throughout multiple services and on all functionalities of the application. As the delays in job processing continued to climb and as our job queues started backing up across multiple services, we restarted a few services in an attempt to mitigate some of the symptoms we were seeing. Soon, it became clear that the issues were stemming from failures in service-to-service communication, and within an hour, the initial degraded state of the application became a significant incident.\n\nAfter continued investigation, digging through logs, metrics, and attempts to connect to services using internal Kubernetes domain names directly from the pods, we suspected that the networking issues leading to communication failures were either due to `kube-proxy`, `core-dns` or `node-local-dns-cache`. This was difficult to verify, as all of those workloads appeared to be healthy.\n\nBetween 20:00 and 21:00 UTC, we decided to restart node-local-dns-cache and core-dns, which caused DNS resolution to fail completely. The team was starting to hone in on `kube-proxy` as the main culprit and the restart of one of the nodes gave us more confidence as we noticed that requests related to that node were going through. At this point, we continued on the restart path and restarted every node. By 23:00, all the nodes were rolled out and we had started seeing recovery except for those jobs using contexts or machine executor. We then restarted a separate pool of dependencies and by 01:15 UTC, March 15th, all jobs were executing correctly.\n\nDuring recovery, we identified that were missing logging for RabbitMQ, so to complete our mitigation efforts, we rolled the rest of our infrastructure. At approximately 02:50 UTC RabbitMQ connection errors led to another episode of delayed jobs that we were able to mitigate by 03:35 UTC. This second incident was fully resolved by 05:14 UTC.\n\nA subsequent restart of the RabbitMQ nodes was carried out to fix a few corrupted queues that caused another degradation in GitHub checks at 09:50 UTC, March 15th. We mitigated the issue by 11:08 UTC and after a long period of monitoring the situation, the incident was fully resolved at 13:15 UTC.\n\n## Post Incident Contributing Events Analysis:\n\nDue to the broad impact of the networking issues, a complete restart of the cluster was ultimately needed to mitigate this issue. At the time of mitigation, it was evident that something in our Kubernetes upgrade process was responsible for this networking failure and further analysis was needed to see what we missed. Upon review, we identified that at the onset of the incident, `kube-proxy`, a network proxy running on every `node` in the Kubernetes cluster had a spike of \"Sync failed\" errors.\n\n```shell\n\"Failed to execute iptables-restore\" err=\"exit status 1 (iptables-restore: line 8022 failed\\n)\"\n\"Sync failed\" retryingTime=\"30s\"\n```\n\nTo understand what’s happening here, it’s important to understand the role of `Kube-proxy` in a cluster. `Pods` \\(smallest deployable units\\) in a cluster have a temporary life cycle. They are ephemeral by nature and are terminated or created as required. Usually, each pod is running a single instance of an application. They are able to reach each other using unique IP addresses that are assigned to them. These IP addresses can change without warning in response to events such as scaling or failures. A set of pods in a cluster are load-balanced by a `Service` object. Services are also assigned a virtual IP address and leverage an `Endpoints` object to keep track of what pods are available at any given time. `Kube-proxy`, as noted above, runs on each node of the cluster and watches the `Service` and `Endpoints` objects. When changes occur in these objects, updates the routing rules on the host nodes are updated using `iptables` \\(the default execution mode for `kube-proxy`\\) a Linux firewall utility that allows or blocks traffic based on defined rules and policies. In a nutshell, `kube-proxy` consumes these `Endpoints` objects and modifies the local node's `iptables` to implement a local load balancer for each Service's virtual IP. As pods are created or destroyed in response to events, `kube-proxy` reconciles the rulesets on the node against the available `Endpoints`.\n\nIn the course of its normal operation `kube-proxy` performs a read/modify/write operation in the [Proxier.syncProxyRules\\(\\)](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/bc4763cbf8b9e6adfbc07bb3194509b187b0b901/pkg/proxy/iptables/proxier.go#L795) method. This method uses the system `iptables-save` and `iptables-restore` commands to read in the state, create new rules, and write the state back out. Between the two Kubernetes versions we were working with, the handling and format of `kube-proxy'`s rulesets changed.\n\nWhat we did not notice was when we rolled back the `kube-proxy` version on March 13th, a very small amount of `Sync-failure` errors started showing up in our logs as visible in the graph below.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/circleci/original/3X/9/a/9a1ba3057da89a317e7088dcb6fb2ffde2c8a4a9.jpeg)\nAs we rolled out more pods and existing `Endpoints` objects changed in response to these events, `kube-proxy`attempted to sync and reconcile the `iptables` on the nodes and failed to do so. These errors increased as more changes to pods and services were introduced during the upgrade process and on March 14th, as we resumed the upgrade, a spike in `sync errors` left the `iptables` on multiple nodes in a very corrupted state.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/circleci/original/3X/f/9/f95a209ec75979639a48fde4a1c25cbd67be6af3.jpeg)\nWhen we restarted the node, a fresh `iptable` ruleset was created and as we completed a full restart of the clusters, the sync errors disappeared restoring networking within the cluster.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement:\n\nAs we analyzed the contributing factors, we realized that there was not one single trigger that led to this incident. Due to the foundational nature of networking, Kubernetes upgrade are inherently risky and our risk mitigation strategies were not effective in the scenario where an interaction of multiple events ultimately triggered this incident. Our infrastructure engineering team is enhancing our Kubernetes upgrade process in order to significantly limit this risk model for future upgrades. In addition, we have enhanced observability with additional metrics and alerts specifically related to the sync errors being thrown by `kube-proxy` during the incident.\n\nAdditionally, we are evaluating strategies to improve the resilience of our RabbitMQ infrastructure.\n\nOnce again, we thank you for your patience as we worked to mitigate the incident and perform a thorough analysis of the events that caused this incident. Our goal remains to continue to improve the resilience and reliability of our application.",

          "body": "## Incident Report: Sept 22, 2022 - Major - All Orbs Inaccessible\n\n## Summary:\n\nOn September 21, 2022, at 22:29 UTC, the orb index was inadvertently deleted due to an incorrect command being issued in a production database. This resulted in all orbs being unavailable, and jobs referencing orbs to fail, for the duration of the incident. We were able to restore the majority of the contents of that database, however the most recent backup at that time was 45 minutes old and any changes to orbs during that 45 minute window were lost. We want to apologize for any disruption this might have caused and to thank our customers for their patience and understanding as we worked to restore normal service.\n\n## What Happened\n\n\\(all times UTC\\)\n\nOn September 21, 2022, for 76 minutes beginning at 22:29, any job that referenced an any orb would fail with an error stating that the referenced orb couldn’t be found. Additionally, orb pages in the registry would return a `404 Not Found` error, and orbs in the CircleCI UI and CLI were inaccessible. Jobs that did not utilize orbs were unaffected.\n\nThis issue was traced back to an incorrectly entered command being issued against all orbs in their database. In most circumstances, our teams utilize our internal administrative tools to remove orbs per a customer request. In this instance, however, an error in that tooling required an engineer to perform a manual operation to remove the requested orb. During that process, an incorrectly entered command caused the removal of all orbs from the database rather than the specific orb requested.\n\nAn incident was declared at 22:48, moving to identified at 22:50. Once identified, the team set about restoring the orbs database to a known good state. On first pass, the team restored a database snapshot from earlier that same day. At this point, 58 minutes after the incident began, functionality was restored and jobs referencing orbs began completing as expected.\n\nFollowing that, at 23:45, the team began retrieving orb changes that occurred between the snapshot time and the time of the deletion. They were able to restore all but the then most recent 45 minutes of changes and the incident was resolved at 00:16.\n\nWith that, any potential changes made to orbs on September 21, 2022 between 21:44 and 22:29 would have been lost. No other customer data, aside from orbs, was affected.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement:\n\nUltimately, human errors are system problems that we can and will solve. In this case, an error in our internal tooling led to a manual procedure that lacked sufficient guardrails to prevent a mistake from occurring. Going forward, we have removed this specific process for deleting orbs through direct access to our production database and we are improving our internal administrative tooling to appropriately handle orb removal with abundant safeguards in place.\n\nAdditionally, the time required to restore data from our backups was longer than we consider acceptable. We’re actively working to improve our backup and restore procedures and documentation to ensure that any downtime required to restore missing data in the future is minimized.",

          "body": "## Incident Report: 2022-09-14 - Pipelines not loading\n\n## Summary:\n\nOn September 14, 2022 from approximately 07:45 to 17:05 UTC, customer pipelines were delayed due to an issue with high load on an internal database that is central to coordinating and orchestrating work on our platform. During this window, all customer pipelines experienced delays in starting. As part of the remediation effort, parts of the the application UI were disabled to reduce load on the impacted system between 08:21 and 15:34 UTC.\n\nThe original status page can be found here: [Pipelines not loading](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/2ccnm7m0gpgs) \n\nWe want to thank our customers for your patience and understanding as we worked to resolve this incident.\n\n## What Happened\n\nAt approximately 07:40 UTC on September 14, there was a sudden increase in disk I/O and CPU utilization on two read-only replicas of a database that is part of the system responsible for coordinating and orchestrating work on the CircleCI platform. By 07:54 internal circuit breakers tripped and an incident was declared.\n\nDuring the incident, engineers rolled the pods of the affected services several times in an attempt to terminate slow-running queries and free up connection pools. The team also enabled an “incident mode” flag that disables portions of the application user interface to help reduce the volume of calls into the database.\n\nThis did succeed in reducing the load temporarily, but the load would quickly spike again as the work queue backed up. After further analysis, the team determined that there were a number of factors contributing to the database load:\n\n* There was a standard background process running that was intended to help clean stale data.\n* A recent change to a database library had enabled SQL comments, and there was a hypothesis that this change had impacted the database’s internal statistics engine due to increasing cardinality of query strings, leading to additional load.\n* A database internal maintenance process started right as the load increased, apparently tipping the system over the edge.\n* Finally, the replicas had originally been sized smaller than the primary, but as additional workloads have shifted to the replicas they were not able to support the same load as the primary. This also contributed to replication lag from the primary, consuming resources and further slowing the responsiveness of the affected system.\n\nAll of these factors contributed to pushing the affected database into a state where it could not keep up with the workload.\n\nThe system was restored to full functionality by scaling up the replicas to match the primary and reverting the change to the database library.\n\nBy 17:05 UTC, the remediation work was completed, all pipelines were processing normally and the UI was re-enabled. Customer builds did continue to flow \\(at reduced capacity\\) for the entire duration of the incident, however in retrospect we did not communicate this effectively during the incident.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement:\n\nOur database engineers have initiated a review and audit of our critical systems to evaluate and shift applicable workloads \\(like reporting and analytics\\) away from critical production systems. This work has been completed for the workflow system affected by this incident, and is ongoing and is targeted for completion by the end of 2022 for the remainder of our critical systems.\n\nThe change to enable SQL comments has now been gated behind a configuration flag and is not enabled by default.\n\nWe are working to revise our incident process to help facilitate more effective communication to our customers during incidents.",
