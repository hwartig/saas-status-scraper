          "body": "## Summary\n\nOn May 1, 2025, from 22:20 UTC to May 2, 2025 02:00 UTC, CircleCI customers experienced delays in starting most jobs. Jobs affected were contained to the following resource classes: Docker large, Docker medium, Docker small and Linux large. During this time customers may have also experienced delays in obtaining status checks.\n\n## What Happened\n\n\\(all times UTC\\)\n\nAt approximately 22:05 on May 1, 2025, we initiated a database upgrade to the service that dispatches jobs. We used a blue/green deployment to stand up a second database running the upgraded version and use logical replication to keep the data across the two databases in sync. We had been running the blue \\(old version\\) and the green \\(new version\\) without issues for a couple days and replication was confirmed to be in sync when we triggered the cut over from blue to green. Upon completion of the cutover process, we noticed application errors for jobs, which meant the application pods failed to automatically pickup the new DNS route. A rolling restart of the pods was performed, and all pods were back online with no further application errors as of 22:17.\n\nAt 22:40, teams were alerted that Docker jobs were backing up. They initially investigated if the pod restarts caused fewer processing nodes to be online, and began to manually scale up the nodes. At 23:47, it was confirmed only a small quantity of jobs were making it through to the processing pods, causing the backlog and ruling out an infrastructure issue. It was determined that jobs in the following resource classes were not executing: Docker large, Docker medium, Docker small and Linux large.\n\nAt 00:40 on May 2, 2025, orphaned task records for the above mentioned resource classes were identified. An orphaned task record is an item of work with no associated jobs, as these records were picked up by the service it causes a failure preventing the next record from being picked up. The team updated the task status to “completed” and immediately saw more jobs processing and the backlog of jobs dropped. By 00:45, the backlog of jobs had completely cleared and the issue was thought to be remediated.\n\nAt 00:56 UTC, an alert triggered, warning of a backlog of jobs once again. Upon investigation, it was determined that only some Docker resource classes were affected. These included large, medium and small, all other resource classes including Linux jobs were operating as expected. An investigation determined additional orphaned task records had been written to the database after 00:40. Logical replication was manually disabled and the orphaned task records were updated at 01:55. At 02:10 the backlog of jobs had once again cleared. The team continued to monitor over the following hour with no additional occurrences of orphaned tasks and declared the incident closed at 03:39.\n\nPost-incident, the team continued to investigate. The root cause was determined to be a race condition between the application and logical replication when the application pods were restarted. A task event was rerun and wrote to the green \\(new\\) database before the original task event status was replicated from the blue \\(old\\) database. This created a unique constraint error that broke replication. Because logical replication does not respect foreign key constraints, task records were replicated to the green database which were older than those already in the green database, creating the orphaned task records seen during the incident. The issue resurfaced immediately after draining the job queue as the failed replication task tried to restart.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement\n\nThe incident has exposed the need to implement further controls on database writes during the upgrade process while using logical replication. Even if replication is in sync, the milliseconds network delay incurred in transferring the data can be enough to trigger this scenario.\n\n1. We will update the upgrade procedure to limit writes to the database for a short period of time while logical replication writes the final updates from the old database version to the new version.\n2. A second data replication verification test will be added to the procedure before turning writes on for the new version.\n3. Once replication is confirmed, in sync replication will be disabled to avoid any possibilities of conflicts.\n4. We will be implementing a more in depth review process between the database and service owner teams to review the upgrade process and risks prior to performing the change.\n\nWe sincerely apologize for the disruption this incident caused to your ability to build on our platform. We understand the critical role CircleCI plays in your development workflow and take any service disruption seriously. We're committed to learning from this experience and have already implemented several measures to prevent similar occurrences in the future.\n\nThank you for your patience and continued trust in CircleCI.",

          "body": "## Summary\n\nOn April 4, 2025, from 00:16 to 01:49 UTC \\(approximately 1 hour and 33 minutes\\), CircleCI experienced a service disruption affecting both our user interface and build capabilities. During this time, customers were unable to access the CircleCI UI or initiate new builds. The incident was caused by an inadvertently applied Web Application Firewall \\(WAF\\) rule that blocked legitimate traffic to CircleCI services. It was resolved when our engineering team identified and removed this rule.\n\n[The original status page can be found here.](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/zh1qd6lrntl7)\n\n## What Happened\n\n\\(all times UTC\\)\n\nThe WAF is a critical security component that sits in front of our services and protects them from malicious traffic, while allowing legitimate requests to pass through. All times below are in UTC\n\n* **00:16**: A WAF rule was inadvertently introduced that began blocking legitimate traffic to CircleCI services.\n* **00:26 - 00:52**: Our monitoring systems detected degraded performance across multiple services. This occurred just as our teams were concluding another [unrelated incident](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/31n0h4tcl02g), which initially caused some confusion about whether the issues might be connected. Customers began reporting inability to access the CircleCI UI or initiate new builds, and our teams pivoted to investigate these new symptoms. The team noted a drop in GitHub webhooks and widespread connectivity issues between our frontend and backend services, spending time to ensure these weren't aftereffects of the previous incident.\n* **00:52**: We established we were looking at a completely separate incident and launched our incident process with a new incident, and a dedicated response team was assembled to investigate the service disruption.\n* **01:15:**  Initial investigation revealed broad connectivity issues between the frontend and our backing APIs, including CORS \\(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\\) errors. The team explored multiple potential causes, including recent deployments and infrastructure changes, but the cause remained unclear.\n* **01:35**: Our automated Terraform drift detection identified a difference in configuration between our defined and current WAF settings. This discovery revealed that a WAF rule had been changed outside of our standard Terraform deployment process, and was blocking legitimate traffic to [api.circleci.com](http://api.circleci.com) and [circleci.com](http://circleci.com) CloudFront distributions.\n* **01:41**: The problematic WAF rule was reverted from both affected CloudFront distributions.\n* **01:49**: Our monitoring confirmed that error rates decreased across all affected services  as traffic was properly routed again. \n* **01:55**: Full service restoration was confirmed across the board at this time. \n* **02:59**: The incident was officially closed after a period of monitoring confirmed stable operation.\n\n## **Root Cause Analysis**\n\nWhile we manage all our infrastructure, including WAF, almost entirely with Terraform, we discovered during this incident a misconfiguration in IAM controls that allowed a specific role to make changes without using our infrastructure-as-code tooling. As a result, while investigating routine security monitoring, an operator manually modified WAF configuration, believing they were taking read-only actions. The resulting change blocked legitimate traffic to our services.\n\nBased on the same assumptions, those investigating the incident did not prioritize investigating WAF configuration expecting that any changes would have gone through our Terraform pipeline and there was no record of such changes.\n\nThe diverse symptoms produced across our platform combined with the occurrence shortly after a separate, [unrelated incident](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/31n0h4tcl02g), led to time spent on paths of inquiry that ultimately proved fruitless.\n\nEventually, our automated drift detection process ran and identified the issue. While this safeguard was invaluable, it was nearly 80 minutes between the initial change and the detection. Drift detection identified the exact configuration change that caused the issue despite the confusion and led directly to the resolution of the incident.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement\n\nThis incident highlighted the strength of our existing systems while identifying several areas where we can improve and make them even more robust:\n\n1. We have implemented stricter IAM policies that prevent direct modification of infrastructure managed by our infrastructure-as-code pipeline.\n2. Terraform's drift detection was instrumental in identifying the root cause of this incident. We are enhancing these capabilities to provide faster alerts when critical infra components deviate from their expected state.  We are also adding  technical guardrails to ensure all configuration management follows this approach, which helps prevent human error and provides better visibility into changes.\n3. Specifically, we're establishing better protocols for implementing and testing WAF rules before they reach production environments. Additionally, we are adding monitoring specifically for WAF behavior and traffic patterns to detect potential issues more quickly.\n4. We're investigating additional technical controls through Security Control Policies \\(SCPs\\) that provide organization-wide restrictions on IAM roles, reducing the risk of accidental misconfigurations. These policies create hard boundaries on what actions can be performed on critical systems like our WAFs, adding an extra layer of protection against unintended changes.\n\nWe sincerely apologize for the disruption this incident caused to your ability to build on our platform. We understand the critical role CircleCI plays in your development workflow and take any service disruption seriously. We're committed to learning from this experience and have already implemented several measures to prevent similar occurrences in the future.\n\nThank you for your patience and continued trust in CircleCI.",

          "body": "## Summary\n\nOn April 3, 2025, from 22:08 UTC to 23:45 UTC, CircleCI customers experienced increased latency and some failures with starting and canceling workflows and jobs.  During this time customers may have experienced delays and difficulty viewing workflows in the UI.  We appreciate your patience and understanding as we worked to resolve this incident.\n\n## What Happened\n\n\\(all times UTC\\)\n\nAt approximately 22:00 on April 4, we initiated an upgrade to the service responsible for workflows. We expected a short delay \\(< 90 seconds\\) during the database upgrade where calls to the database from the workflows service would get sent to a queue and retried over a 10 minute period. We expected to see the queues grow slightly during and immediately after the upgrade.  At 22:08, when the blue/green deployment was complete, we verified queries being served. At 22:17, we identified increased latency in the workflows service, as well as some errors from jobs being dropped due to exhausting their 10 minute retries.\n\nAt 22:29 additional engineers were engaged, and at 22:30 the team restarted the workflows pods to ensure they were all connecting to the correct database. At 22:35 a public incident was declared.  At 22:41, it was observed that all queries on the new database were hitting disk, which indicated that the database statistics tables had not updated.  The team immediately upsized the database and disabled any non business critical operations on the database.   At 23:00, the workflows service was scaled down to a single pod to give the database capacity to recover while the statistics table was rebuilt.  \n\nAt 23:10, the team observed the workflows queue backing up due to the reduction in pods as expected but also did not see an improvement in database performance.  At 23:19, the team decided to re-enable writes on the old database and reinstate its primary status to restore service to customers sooner. This work completed at 23:29.  The team continued to monitor the workflows queue.  At 23:45 it was determined that the workflow queue was back to normal operating levels, and no further errors were observed.\n\nPost-incident, the team continued to investigate.  The root cause was determined to be that the analyze operation to rebuild the database’s statistics table, which is used for indexes, had been executed too early in the operation and was made stale by a second major version upgrade within the same deployment.  \n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement\n\nThe blue/green database deployment procedures have been updated to run an analysis procedure after every major version change.  The team has also tested running the analyze command while a database is under pressure to determine it has no further degrading effects on the database performance.  This will be noted for future remediation.\n\nBefore any additional migrations are run, the team will add additional automated tests and manual checkpoints throughout the process to identify and resolve issues before the blue/green cutover.",

This was due to a code change deployed at 19:48 UTC that negatively impacted the service responsible for sending commit statuses to the Version Control System \\(VCS\\) provider.\n\n## What Happened\n\nOn January 23, 2025, at 19:48 UTC, we deployed a change in how we send events from our service that orchestrates workflows. This change inadvertently modified the value of a key field used by a downstream service responsible for setting commit statuses.\n\nAt 20:03 UTC, the team responsible for the downstream service was alerted to an increase in errors when setting commit statuses. This alert auto-resolved without intervention, delaying our response time.\n\nAt 20:12 UTC, our support team notified us that customers were experiencing issues with commit status updates. This prompted an investigation. By 20:40 UTC, we had identified and reverted the faulty code change, with customer impact ceasing at 20:43 UTC.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement\n\nWe will add more comprehensive testing to cover the events sent by our orchestration service. Additionally, we will implement synthetic tests to catch failures in setting proper commit status updates.\n\nWe are also investigating why the alert auto-resolved to ensure similar issues are actioned sooner.\n\nWhile investigation and remediation started promptly after being notified of the issue, there was a delay in initializing our incident protocol, which delayed the creation of a status page update and limited the information available to provide clear timing on the published update. We are revisiting our incident declaration procedures and tool configuration to provide further clarity around incident declaration and improve response time.",

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we worked to resolve this incident.\n\n## What Happened\n\n\\(all times UTC\\)\n\nAt approximately 23:00 on January 21, an automated alert indicated that a database instance responsible for holding archived data was almost out of free storage space. At 23:09, the team halted a blue/green deployment on the database to free a logical replication slot, thinking that may have been the cause, but that did not help the database recover.\n\nThe archival service is called synchronously by the service responsible for orchestrating workflows. When the archival service’s database reached capacity, these requests started timing out, which impacted the overall performance of the workflows service. At 23:26, the workflows queue began to grow, leading to increased latency starting workflows and jobs, canceling jobs, and viewing workflows in the UI. This was not immediately attributed to the archival database issues in part because there was a separate alert at approximately the same time related to request volume, but when the queue continued to grow after that issue resolved, a separate team began to investigate workflows further and scaled up the event consumer responsible for processing the queue at 23:44.\n\nThe team investigating the unhealthy database instance promoted a read replica to a standalone primary at 23:55. By 00:03, the workflows queue depth returned to normal, which resolved workflow latency and UI impacts. However, at around the same time, Linux machine jobs began to queue downstream due to errors trying to provision instances with our cloud provider, which was actively investigating increased API error rates to the provisioning endpoint in our region. Requests began to be fulfilled around 00:32, but due to the volume of requests being processed, we also experienced rate limiting that extended the length of impact. Our queues returned to normal levels at 00:56, and the incident resolved at 01:26 after confirming there was no further impact.\n\nPost-incident, the team continued to investigate. The root cause was determined to be a code change made to a function in the impacted database on January 16th, which unintentionally created an excessive number of log messages. The function has been updated to fix this behavior.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement\n\nWe have added a max duration to the workflows retry policy for archiving workflows to allow it to fail earlier than the default timeout, limiting the potential impact on the workflows service should there be a future issue with the archival service. Longer-term, we intend to shift the workflow archival process to an event-based model to decouple the services.\n\nWhile alerting did indicate an issue with the archival database, the team did not have much time to address the problem before it caused customer impact because the database was filling significantly more quickly than previously forecasted. We will be implementing forecast and anomaly monitoring for our databases to alert us of unusual activity before it reaches critical levels.",
