          "body": "## Summary\n\nOn April 3, 2025, from 22:08 UTC to 23:45 UTC, CircleCI customers experienced increased latency and some failures with starting and canceling workflows and jobs.  During this time customers may have experienced delays and difficulty viewing workflows in the UI.  We appreciate your patience and understanding as we worked to resolve this incident.\n\n## What Happened\n\n\\(all times UTC\\)\n\nAt approximately 22:00 on April 4, we initiated an upgrade to the service responsible for workflows. We expected a short delay \\(< 90 seconds\\) during the database upgrade where calls to the database from the workflows service would get sent to a queue and retried over a 10 minute period. We expected to see the queues grow slightly during and immediately after the upgrade.  At 22:08, when the blue/green deployment was complete, we verified queries being served. At 22:17, we identified increased latency in the workflows service, as well as some errors from jobs being dropped due to exhausting their 10 minute retries.\n\nAt 22:29 additional engineers were engaged, and at 22:30 the team restarted the workflows pods to ensure they were all connecting to the correct database. At 22:35 a public incident was declared.  At 22:41, it was observed that all queries on the new database were hitting disk, which indicated that the database statistics tables had not updated.  The team immediately upsized the database and disabled any non business critical operations on the database.   At 23:00, the workflows service was scaled down to a single pod to give the database capacity to recover while the statistics table was rebuilt.  \n\nAt 23:10, the team observed the workflows queue backing up due to the reduction in pods as expected but also did not see an improvement in database performance.  At 23:19, the team decided to re-enable writes on the old database and reinstate its primary status to restore service to customers sooner. This work completed at 23:29.  The team continued to monitor the workflows queue.  At 23:45 it was determined that the workflow queue was back to normal operating levels, and no further errors were observed.\n\nPost-incident, the team continued to investigate.  The root cause was determined to be that the analyze operation to rebuild the database’s statistics table, which is used for indexes, had been executed too early in the operation and was made stale by a second major version upgrade within the same deployment.  \n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement\n\nThe blue/green database deployment procedures have been updated to run an analysis procedure after every major version change.  The team has also tested running the analyze command while a database is under pressure to determine it has no further degrading effects on the database performance.  This will be noted for future remediation.\n\nBefore any additional migrations are run, the team will add additional automated tests and manual checkpoints throughout the process to identify and resolve issues before the blue/green cutover.",

This was due to a code change deployed at 19:48 UTC that negatively impacted the service responsible for sending commit statuses to the Version Control System \\(VCS\\) provider.\n\n## What Happened\n\nOn January 23, 2025, at 19:48 UTC, we deployed a change in how we send events from our service that orchestrates workflows. This change inadvertently modified the value of a key field used by a downstream service responsible for setting commit statuses.\n\nAt 20:03 UTC, the team responsible for the downstream service was alerted to an increase in errors when setting commit statuses. This alert auto-resolved without intervention, delaying our response time.\n\nAt 20:12 UTC, our support team notified us that customers were experiencing issues with commit status updates. This prompted an investigation. By 20:40 UTC, we had identified and reverted the faulty code change, with customer impact ceasing at 20:43 UTC.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement\n\nWe will add more comprehensive testing to cover the events sent by our orchestration service. Additionally, we will implement synthetic tests to catch failures in setting proper commit status updates.\n\nWe are also investigating why the alert auto-resolved to ensure similar issues are actioned sooner.\n\nWhile investigation and remediation started promptly after being notified of the issue, there was a delay in initializing our incident protocol, which delayed the creation of a status page update and limited the information available to provide clear timing on the published update. We are revisiting our incident declaration procedures and tool configuration to provide further clarity around incident declaration and improve response time.",

          "body": "## Summary\n\nFrom January 21, 2025 at 23:50 UTC to January 22, 2025 at 00:56 UTC, CircleCI customers experienced increased latency with starting and canceling workflows and jobs, and experienced delays and difficulty viewing workflows in the UI. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we worked to resolve this incident.\n\n## What Happened\n\n\\(all times UTC\\)\n\nAt approximately 23:00 on January 21, an automated alert indicated that a database instance responsible for holding archived data was almost out of free storage space. At 23:09, the team halted a blue/green deployment on the database to free a logical replication slot, thinking that may have been the cause, but that did not help the database recover.\n\nThe archival service is called synchronously by the service responsible for orchestrating workflows. When the archival service’s database reached capacity, these requests started timing out, which impacted the overall performance of the workflows service. At 23:26, the workflows queue began to grow, leading to increased latency starting workflows and jobs, canceling jobs, and viewing workflows in the UI. This was not immediately attributed to the archival database issues in part because there was a separate alert at approximately the same time related to request volume, but when the queue continued to grow after that issue resolved, a separate team began to investigate workflows further and scaled up the event consumer responsible for processing the queue at 23:44.\n\nThe team investigating the unhealthy database instance promoted a read replica to a standalone primary at 23:55. By 00:03, the workflows queue depth returned to normal, which resolved workflow latency and UI impacts. However, at around the same time, Linux machine jobs began to queue downstream due to errors trying to provision instances with our cloud provider, which was actively investigating increased API error rates to the provisioning endpoint in our region. Requests began to be fulfilled around 00:32, but due to the volume of requests being processed, we also experienced rate limiting that extended the length of impact. Our queues returned to normal levels at 00:56, and the incident resolved at 01:26 after confirming there was no further impact.\n\nPost-incident, the team continued to investigate. The root cause was determined to be a code change made to a function in the impacted database on January 16th, which unintentionally created an excessive number of log messages. The function has been updated to fix this behavior.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement\n\nWe have added a max duration to the workflows retry policy for archiving workflows to allow it to fail earlier than the default timeout, limiting the potential impact on the workflows service should there be a future issue with the archival service. Longer-term, we intend to shift the workflow archival process to an event-based model to decouple the services.\n\nWhile alerting did indicate an issue with the archival database, the team did not have much time to address the problem before it caused customer impact because the database was filling significantly more quickly than previously forecasted. We will be implementing forecast and anomaly monitoring for our databases to alert us of unusual activity before it reaches critical levels.",

          "body": "## Summary:\n\nOn October 22, 2024, from 14:45 to 15:52 and again from 17:41 to 18:22 UTC, CircleCI customers experienced failures on new job submissions as well as failures on jobs that were in progress. A sudden increase in the number of tasks completing simultaneously and requests to upload artifacts from jobs overloaded the service responsible for managing job output.\n\nOn October 28, 2024, from 13:27 to 14:13 and from 14:58 to 15:50, CircleCI customers experienced a recurrence of these effects due to a similar cause.\n\nDuring these sets of incidents, customers would have experienced their jobs failing to start with an infrastructure failure. Jobs that were already in progress also failed with an infrastructure failure. We want to thank our customers for your patience and understanding as we worked to resolve these incidents.\n\nThe original status pages for the incidents on October 22 can be found [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/6yjv79g764yc) and [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/0crxbhkflndc). The status pages for incidents on October 28 can be found [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/xk37ycndxbhc) and [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/8ktdwlsf2lm8).\n\n## What Happened:\n\n\\(All times UTC\\)\n\nOn October 22, 2024, at 14:45 there was a sudden increase of customer tasks completing at the same time within CircleCI. In order to record each of these task end events, including the amount of storage the task used, the system that manages task state \\(distributor\\) made calls to our internal API gateway, which subsequently queried the system responsible for storing job output \\(output service\\). At this point, output service became overwhelmed with requests; although some requests were handled successfully, the vast majority were delayed before finally receiving a `499 Client Closed Request` error response.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/circleci/original/3X/2/b/2b68322aaf27124eb5ae63a15bc0f8f2118c3f7b.png)\n`Distributor task end calls to the internal API gateway`\n\nAdditionally, at 14:50, output service received an influx of artifact upload requests, further straining resources in the service.\n\nAn incident was officially declared at 14:57. Output service was scaled horizontally at 15:16 to handle the additional load it was receiving. Internal health checks began to recover at 15:25, and we continued to monitor output service until incoming requests returned to normal levels. The incident was resolved at 15:52 and we kept output service horizontally scaled.\n\nAt 17:41, output service received another sharp increase in requests to upload artifacts and was unable to keep up with the additional load, causing jobs to fail again. An incident was declared at 17:57. Because output service was still horizontally scaled from the initial incident, it automatically recovered by 18:00. As a proactive measure, we further scaled output service horizontally at 18:02. We continued to monitor our systems until the incident was resolved at 18:22.\n\nFollowing incident resolution, we continued our investigation and uncovered on October 25 that our internal API gateway was configured with low values for the maximum number of connections allowed to each of the services that experienced increased load on October 22. We immediately increased these values so that the gateway could handle increased volume of task end events moving forward.\n\nDespite these improvements, on October 28, 2024, at 13:27, customer jobs started to fail in the same way as they previously did on October 22. An incident was officially declared at 13:38. By 13:48, the system automatically recovered without any intervention and the incident was resolved at 14:13.\n\nWe continued to investigate the root cause of the delays and failures, but at 14:45 customer jobs started to fail again in the same way. We declared another incident at 14:50. In order to reduce the load on output service, we removed the retry logic when requesting storage used per task from output service. This allowed tasks to complete even if storage used could not be retrieved \\(to the customer’s benefit\\). Additionally, we scaled distributor horizontally at 15:19 in order to handle the increased load. At 15:21, our systems began to recover. We continued to monitor and resolved the incident at 15:51.\n\nWe returned to our investigation into the root cause of this recurring behavior and discovered that there was an additional client in distributor that was configured with a low value for maximum number of connections to our internal API gateway. We increased this value at 17:33.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement:\n\nFollowing the remediation on October 28, we conducted an audit of **all** of the HTTP clients in the execution environment and proactively increased those that were similarly configured to ones in the internal API gateway and distributor.\n\nAdditionally, we identified a gap in observability with these HTTP clients that prevented us from identifying the root cause of these sets of incidents sooner. We immediately added additional observability to all of the clients in order to enable better alerting if connections pools were to become exhausted again in the future.",

          "body": "## Summary:\n\nOn October 22, 2024, from 14:45 to 15:52 and again from 17:41 to 18:22 UTC, CircleCI customers experienced failures on new job submissions as well as failures on jobs that were in progress. A sudden increase in the number of tasks completing simultaneously and requests to upload artifacts from jobs overloaded the service responsible for managing job output.\n\nOn October 28, 2024, from 13:27 to 14:13 and from 14:58 to 15:50, CircleCI customers experienced a recurrence of these effects due to a similar cause.\n\nDuring these sets of incidents, customers would have experienced their jobs failing to start with an infrastructure failure. Jobs that were already in progress also failed with an infrastructure failure. We want to thank our customers for your patience and understanding as we worked to resolve these incidents.\n\nThe original status pages for the incidents on October 22 can be found [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/6yjv79g764yc) and [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/0crxbhkflndc). The status pages for incidents on October 28 can be found [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/xk37ycndxbhc) and [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/8ktdwlsf2lm8).\n\n## What Happened:\n\n\\(All times UTC\\)\n\nOn October 22, 2024, at 14:45 there was a sudden increase of customer tasks completing at the same time within CircleCI. In order to record each of these task end events, including the amount of storage the task used, the system that manages task state \\(distributor\\) made calls to our internal API gateway, which subsequently queried the system responsible for storing job output \\(output service\\). At this point, output service became overwhelmed with requests; although some requests were handled successfully, the vast majority were delayed before finally receiving a `499 Client Closed Request` error response.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/circleci/original/3X/2/b/2b68322aaf27124eb5ae63a15bc0f8f2118c3f7b.png)\n`Distributor task end calls to the internal API gateway`\n\nAdditionally, at 14:50, output service received an influx of artifact upload requests, further straining resources in the service.\n\nAn incident was officially declared at 14:57. Output service was scaled horizontally at 15:16 to handle the additional load it was receiving. Internal health checks began to recover at 15:25, and we continued to monitor output service until incoming requests returned to normal levels. The incident was resolved at 15:52 and we kept output service horizontally scaled.\n\nAt 17:41, output service received another sharp increase in requests to upload artifacts and was unable to keep up with the additional load, causing jobs to fail again. An incident was declared at 17:57. Because output service was still horizontally scaled from the initial incident, it automatically recovered by 18:00. As a proactive measure, we further scaled output service horizontally at 18:02. We continued to monitor our systems until the incident was resolved at 18:22.\n\nFollowing incident resolution, we continued our investigation and uncovered on October 25 that our internal API gateway was configured with low values for the maximum number of connections allowed to each of the services that experienced increased load on October 22. We immediately increased these values so that the gateway could handle increased volume of task end events moving forward.\n\nDespite these improvements, on October 28, 2024, at 13:27, customer jobs started to fail in the same way as they previously did on October 22. An incident was officially declared at 13:38. By 13:48, the system automatically recovered without any intervention and the incident was resolved at 14:13.\n\nWe continued to investigate the root cause of the delays and failures, but at 14:45 customer jobs started to fail again in the same way. We declared another incident at 14:50. In order to reduce the load on output service, we removed the retry logic when requesting storage used per task from output service. This allowed tasks to complete even if storage used could not be retrieved \\(to the customer’s benefit\\). Additionally, we scaled distributor horizontally at 15:19 in order to handle the increased load. At 15:21, our systems began to recover. We continued to monitor and resolved the incident at 15:51.\n\nWe returned to our investigation into the root cause of this recurring behavior and discovered that there was an additional client in distributor that was configured with a low value for maximum number of connections to our internal API gateway. We increased this value at 17:33.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement:\n\nFollowing the remediation on October 28, we conducted an audit of **all** of the HTTP clients in the execution environment and proactively increased those that were similarly configured to ones in the internal API gateway and distributor.\n\nAdditionally, we identified a gap in observability with these HTTP clients that prevented us from identifying the root cause of these sets of incidents sooner. We immediately added additional observability to all of the clients in order to enable better alerting if connections pools were to become exhausted again in the future.",

          "body": "## Summary:\n\nOn September 11, 2024, from 10:16 to 21:00 UTC CircleCI customers encountered multiple issues, including delays in starting jobs, slow processing of job outputs and task status messages \\(such as the completion of steps and tasks\\), dropped workflows, and a rise in infrastructure failures. These problems collectively affected all jobs during this time frame.\n\nTo address these issues, we worked to stabilize the service responsible for ingesting and serving the step output as well as tracking the start and end times of individual steps \\(**step service**\\) until 19:00 UTC, at which point it was determined to be in a sustainable state. Despite this progress, delays in starting Mac jobs persisted until 20:30 UTC, largely due to a backlog of jobs waiting to start and a failure to properly garbage collect \\(GC\\) old virtual machines \\(VMs\\). This combination of factors contributed to a challenging operational environment for CircleCI customers.\n\nThe original status page can be found [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/lsv2ry3jr16c).\n\n## What Happened\n\n\\(All times UTC\\)\n\nOn September 11, 2024, for approximately 10 hours, CircleCI experienced significant service disruptions. The incident began at 10:05 when a particularly potent configuration was executed during an internal test. By 10:14, the job ended, but efforts to generate test results led to a spike in memory usage, causing Out of Memory \\(OOM\\) errors for several internal services. This resulted in failures in processing job submissions and dispatching tasks, which impacted all customer jobs.\n\nBy 10:16, job starts across all executors had completely failed, as the service responsible for processing and storing test results, as well as handling storage of job records \\(**output service**\\) became overwhelmed and unable to service requests. An official incident declaration occurred at 10:20.\n\nWe triggered a deployment restart at 10:23, which initially allowed for some recovery before the service was again overwhelmed at approximately 10:27. To address these issues, we horizontally and vertically scaled the service. This adjustment allowed the service to stabilize and for customer jobs to start flowing again.\n\nThroughout the incident, machine jobs faced specific challenges due to timeouts. By 13:00, we detected abnormal resource utilization in step service, prompting us to monitor the situation closely. We believed the ongoing issues were related to a thundering herd effect stemming from an earlier incident.\n\nBetween 14:47 and 15:05 our efforts to stabilize the system included increasing memory for the service processing step output multiple times throughout this incident in an ongoing attempt to manage the backlog and prevent OOM kills.\n\nAt 16:21, in order to process the load of the thundering herd of built up workload, we had to raise memory limits in multiple locations in order to allow work to process without causing outages. This marked the beginning of a significant recovery. The existing Redis cluster was under heavy CPU load, prompting a decision at 16:30 to spin up a second Redis cluster to alleviate the pressure.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/circleci/original/3X/c/f/cfbf14664563f62c4d331c0aed80b152ccdc1d5c.png)\n`Redis Engine CPU Utilization Impact Timeline`\n\nBy 17:00, the job queue began to decrease significantly as the service stabilized. Throughout the afternoon, we continued to monitor and adjust resources, ultimately doubling Redis shards around 18:11, which had an immediate positive effect on reducing load.\n\nDuring this incident, customers experienced significantly longer response times for API calls from servers running customer workloads reporting back the output of jobs. The 95th percentile \\(p95\\) response times spiked to between 5 and 15 seconds from 14:20 to 19:50, compared to the usual expectation of around 100 milliseconds.\n\nThis led to degraded step output on the jobs page, with issues such as delays in displaying the output of the customer steps, missing output of customer steps, and, in some cases, no output of customer steps at all. These delays likely resulted in slower Task performance, as sending step output to the step receiver took longer, blocking other actions within the Tasks. While the average Task runtime increased, the specific impact varied depending on the Task's contents.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/circleci/original/3X/c/6/c600d16b22a0f27de0827edca9d4c55a2e56ea25.png)\n`Task Wait Time`\n\n\n_Linux:_\n\n* **12:10 - 13:05:** Wait times under 1 minute.\n* **13:40 - 15:30:** Degraded wait times, generally under 5 minutes.\n* **15:30 - 18:05:** Wait times increased to tens of minutes, with some recovery starting around 17:45.\n* **18:05 - 20:00:** Continued degraded wait times of 2-3 minutes.\n* **20:00:** Fully recovered.\n\n_Windows:_\n\n* **12:10 - 15:40:** Degraded wait times, typically under 5 minutes.\n* **15:40 - 17:15:** Wait times reached tens of minutes.\n* **17:15 - 19:35:** Returned to degraded wait times, usually under 5 minutes.\n* **19:35 - 19:55:** Wait times again increased to tens of minutes.\n* **19:55:** Fully recovered.\n\n_Mac OS:_\n\n* **12:10 - 15:30:** Degraded wait times, generally under 5 minutes.\n* **15:30 - 21:00:** Wait times escalated to tens of minutes.\n* **21:00:** Fully recovered.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement:\n\nIn response to this incident, we are implementing several key improvements to enhance service reliability. First, we will enhance how tasks are cleared during infrastructure failures, which will help streamline operations. We will put in guardrails in the system to prevent execution of pathological workloads.\n\nAdditionally, we will implement a mechanism that will allow us to temporarily prevent jobs that have failed due to infrastructure issues from being retried. We will adjust Redis health checks by moving them from liveness probes to readiness probes, and we plan to increase the number of Redis shards to better distribute load and minimize the impact of a single shard being blocked. During our investigation we identified a self-reenforcing cycle of poorly performing Redis commands \\(scans\\) that were the root cause of Redis failing, and we’re going to address this as well.\n\nTo enhance stability, we will introduce a timeout for step data based on job maximum runtime and reduce the pressure a single job can place on the S3 connection pool.\n\nWe are also looking to develop a method to pause live deployments from the CircleCI app during incidents, ensuring that delayed changes do not overwrite manual adjustments made in the interim.",
