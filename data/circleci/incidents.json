          "body": "## Summary:\n\nOn October 22, 2024, from 14:45 to 15:52 and again from 17:41 to 18:22 UTC, CircleCI customers experienced failures on new job submissions as well as failures on jobs that were in progress. A sudden increase in the number of tasks completing simultaneously and requests to upload artifacts from jobs overloaded the service responsible for managing job output.\n\nOn October 28, 2024, from 13:27 to 14:13 and from 14:58 to 15:50, CircleCI customers experienced a recurrence of these effects due to a similar cause.\n\nDuring these sets of incidents, customers would have experienced their jobs failing to start with an infrastructure failure. Jobs that were already in progress also failed with an infrastructure failure. We want to thank our customers for your patience and understanding as we worked to resolve these incidents.\n\nThe original status pages for the incidents on October 22 can be found [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/6yjv79g764yc) and [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/0crxbhkflndc). The status pages for incidents on October 28 can be found [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/xk37ycndxbhc) and [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/8ktdwlsf2lm8).\n\n## What Happened:\n\n\\(All times UTC\\)\n\nOn October 22, 2024, at 14:45 there was a sudden increase of customer tasks completing at the same time within CircleCI. In order to record each of these task end events, including the amount of storage the task used, the system that manages task state \\(distributor\\) made calls to our internal API gateway, which subsequently queried the system responsible for storing job output \\(output service\\). At this point, output service became overwhelmed with requests; although some requests were handled successfully, the vast majority were delayed before finally receiving a `499 Client Closed Request` error response.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/circleci/original/3X/2/b/2b68322aaf27124eb5ae63a15bc0f8f2118c3f7b.png)\n`Distributor task end calls to the internal API gateway`\n\nAdditionally, at 14:50, output service received an influx of artifact upload requests, further straining resources in the service.\n\nAn incident was officially declared at 14:57. Output service was scaled horizontally at 15:16 to handle the additional load it was receiving. Internal health checks began to recover at 15:25, and we continued to monitor output service until incoming requests returned to normal levels. The incident was resolved at 15:52 and we kept output service horizontally scaled.\n\nAt 17:41, output service received another sharp increase in requests to upload artifacts and was unable to keep up with the additional load, causing jobs to fail again. An incident was declared at 17:57. Because output service was still horizontally scaled from the initial incident, it automatically recovered by 18:00. As a proactive measure, we further scaled output service horizontally at 18:02. We continued to monitor our systems until the incident was resolved at 18:22.\n\nFollowing incident resolution, we continued our investigation and uncovered on October 25 that our internal API gateway was configured with low values for the maximum number of connections allowed to each of the services that experienced increased load on October 22. We immediately increased these values so that the gateway could handle increased volume of task end events moving forward.\n\nDespite these improvements, on October 28, 2024, at 13:27, customer jobs started to fail in the same way as they previously did on October 22. An incident was officially declared at 13:38. By 13:48, the system automatically recovered without any intervention and the incident was resolved at 14:13.\n\nWe continued to investigate the root cause of the delays and failures, but at 14:45 customer jobs started to fail again in the same way. We declared another incident at 14:50. In order to reduce the load on output service, we removed the retry logic when requesting storage used per task from output service. This allowed tasks to complete even if storage used could not be retrieved \\(to the customer’s benefit\\). Additionally, we scaled distributor horizontally at 15:19 in order to handle the increased load. At 15:21, our systems began to recover. We continued to monitor and resolved the incident at 15:51.\n\nWe returned to our investigation into the root cause of this recurring behavior and discovered that there was an additional client in distributor that was configured with a low value for maximum number of connections to our internal API gateway. We increased this value at 17:33.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement:\n\nFollowing the remediation on October 28, we conducted an audit of **all** of the HTTP clients in the execution environment and proactively increased those that were similarly configured to ones in the internal API gateway and distributor.\n\nAdditionally, we identified a gap in observability with these HTTP clients that prevented us from identifying the root cause of these sets of incidents sooner. We immediately added additional observability to all of the clients in order to enable better alerting if connections pools were to become exhausted again in the future.",

          "body": "## Summary:\n\nOn October 22, 2024, from 14:45 to 15:52 and again from 17:41 to 18:22 UTC, CircleCI customers experienced failures on new job submissions as well as failures on jobs that were in progress. A sudden increase in the number of tasks completing simultaneously and requests to upload artifacts from jobs overloaded the service responsible for managing job output.\n\nOn October 28, 2024, from 13:27 to 14:13 and from 14:58 to 15:50, CircleCI customers experienced a recurrence of these effects due to a similar cause.\n\nDuring these sets of incidents, customers would have experienced their jobs failing to start with an infrastructure failure. Jobs that were already in progress also failed with an infrastructure failure. We want to thank our customers for your patience and understanding as we worked to resolve these incidents.\n\nThe original status pages for the incidents on October 22 can be found [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/6yjv79g764yc) and [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/0crxbhkflndc). The status pages for incidents on October 28 can be found [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/xk37ycndxbhc) and [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/8ktdwlsf2lm8).\n\n## What Happened:\n\n\\(All times UTC\\)\n\nOn October 22, 2024, at 14:45 there was a sudden increase of customer tasks completing at the same time within CircleCI. In order to record each of these task end events, including the amount of storage the task used, the system that manages task state \\(distributor\\) made calls to our internal API gateway, which subsequently queried the system responsible for storing job output \\(output service\\). At this point, output service became overwhelmed with requests; although some requests were handled successfully, the vast majority were delayed before finally receiving a `499 Client Closed Request` error response.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/circleci/original/3X/2/b/2b68322aaf27124eb5ae63a15bc0f8f2118c3f7b.png)\n`Distributor task end calls to the internal API gateway`\n\nAdditionally, at 14:50, output service received an influx of artifact upload requests, further straining resources in the service.\n\nAn incident was officially declared at 14:57. Output service was scaled horizontally at 15:16 to handle the additional load it was receiving. Internal health checks began to recover at 15:25, and we continued to monitor output service until incoming requests returned to normal levels. The incident was resolved at 15:52 and we kept output service horizontally scaled.\n\nAt 17:41, output service received another sharp increase in requests to upload artifacts and was unable to keep up with the additional load, causing jobs to fail again. An incident was declared at 17:57. Because output service was still horizontally scaled from the initial incident, it automatically recovered by 18:00. As a proactive measure, we further scaled output service horizontally at 18:02. We continued to monitor our systems until the incident was resolved at 18:22.\n\nFollowing incident resolution, we continued our investigation and uncovered on October 25 that our internal API gateway was configured with low values for the maximum number of connections allowed to each of the services that experienced increased load on October 22. We immediately increased these values so that the gateway could handle increased volume of task end events moving forward.\n\nDespite these improvements, on October 28, 2024, at 13:27, customer jobs started to fail in the same way as they previously did on October 22. An incident was officially declared at 13:38. By 13:48, the system automatically recovered without any intervention and the incident was resolved at 14:13.\n\nWe continued to investigate the root cause of the delays and failures, but at 14:45 customer jobs started to fail again in the same way. We declared another incident at 14:50. In order to reduce the load on output service, we removed the retry logic when requesting storage used per task from output service. This allowed tasks to complete even if storage used could not be retrieved \\(to the customer’s benefit\\). Additionally, we scaled distributor horizontally at 15:19 in order to handle the increased load. At 15:21, our systems began to recover. We continued to monitor and resolved the incident at 15:51.\n\nWe returned to our investigation into the root cause of this recurring behavior and discovered that there was an additional client in distributor that was configured with a low value for maximum number of connections to our internal API gateway. We increased this value at 17:33.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement:\n\nFollowing the remediation on October 28, we conducted an audit of **all** of the HTTP clients in the execution environment and proactively increased those that were similarly configured to ones in the internal API gateway and distributor.\n\nAdditionally, we identified a gap in observability with these HTTP clients that prevented us from identifying the root cause of these sets of incidents sooner. We immediately added additional observability to all of the clients in order to enable better alerting if connections pools were to become exhausted again in the future.",

          "body": "## Summary:\n\nOn September 11, 2024, from 10:16 to 21:00 UTC CircleCI customers encountered multiple issues, including delays in starting jobs, slow processing of job outputs and task status messages \\(such as the completion of steps and tasks\\), dropped workflows, and a rise in infrastructure failures. These problems collectively affected all jobs during this time frame.\n\nTo address these issues, we worked to stabilize the service responsible for ingesting and serving the step output as well as tracking the start and end times of individual steps \\(**step service**\\) until 19:00 UTC, at which point it was determined to be in a sustainable state. Despite this progress, delays in starting Mac jobs persisted until 20:30 UTC, largely due to a backlog of jobs waiting to start and a failure to properly garbage collect \\(GC\\) old virtual machines \\(VMs\\). This combination of factors contributed to a challenging operational environment for CircleCI customers.\n\nThe original status page can be found [here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/lsv2ry3jr16c).\n\n## What Happened\n\n\\(All times UTC\\)\n\nOn September 11, 2024, for approximately 10 hours, CircleCI experienced significant service disruptions. The incident began at 10:05 when a particularly potent configuration was executed during an internal test. By 10:14, the job ended, but efforts to generate test results led to a spike in memory usage, causing Out of Memory \\(OOM\\) errors for several internal services. This resulted in failures in processing job submissions and dispatching tasks, which impacted all customer jobs.\n\nBy 10:16, job starts across all executors had completely failed, as the service responsible for processing and storing test results, as well as handling storage of job records \\(**output service**\\) became overwhelmed and unable to service requests. An official incident declaration occurred at 10:20.\n\nWe triggered a deployment restart at 10:23, which initially allowed for some recovery before the service was again overwhelmed at approximately 10:27. To address these issues, we horizontally and vertically scaled the service. This adjustment allowed the service to stabilize and for customer jobs to start flowing again.\n\nThroughout the incident, machine jobs faced specific challenges due to timeouts. By 13:00, we detected abnormal resource utilization in step service, prompting us to monitor the situation closely. We believed the ongoing issues were related to a thundering herd effect stemming from an earlier incident.\n\nBetween 14:47 and 15:05 our efforts to stabilize the system included increasing memory for the service processing step output multiple times throughout this incident in an ongoing attempt to manage the backlog and prevent OOM kills.\n\nAt 16:21, in order to process the load of the thundering herd of built up workload, we had to raise memory limits in multiple locations in order to allow work to process without causing outages. This marked the beginning of a significant recovery. The existing Redis cluster was under heavy CPU load, prompting a decision at 16:30 to spin up a second Redis cluster to alleviate the pressure.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/circleci/original/3X/c/f/cfbf14664563f62c4d331c0aed80b152ccdc1d5c.png)\n`Redis Engine CPU Utilization Impact Timeline`\n\nBy 17:00, the job queue began to decrease significantly as the service stabilized. Throughout the afternoon, we continued to monitor and adjust resources, ultimately doubling Redis shards around 18:11, which had an immediate positive effect on reducing load.\n\nDuring this incident, customers experienced significantly longer response times for API calls from servers running customer workloads reporting back the output of jobs. The 95th percentile \\(p95\\) response times spiked to between 5 and 15 seconds from 14:20 to 19:50, compared to the usual expectation of around 100 milliseconds.\n\nThis led to degraded step output on the jobs page, with issues such as delays in displaying the output of the customer steps, missing output of customer steps, and, in some cases, no output of customer steps at all. These delays likely resulted in slower Task performance, as sending step output to the step receiver took longer, blocking other actions within the Tasks. While the average Task runtime increased, the specific impact varied depending on the Task's contents.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/circleci/original/3X/c/6/c600d16b22a0f27de0827edca9d4c55a2e56ea25.png)\n`Task Wait Time`\n\n\n_Linux:_\n\n* **12:10 - 13:05:** Wait times under 1 minute.\n* **13:40 - 15:30:** Degraded wait times, generally under 5 minutes.\n* **15:30 - 18:05:** Wait times increased to tens of minutes, with some recovery starting around 17:45.\n* **18:05 - 20:00:** Continued degraded wait times of 2-3 minutes.\n* **20:00:** Fully recovered.\n\n_Windows:_\n\n* **12:10 - 15:40:** Degraded wait times, typically under 5 minutes.\n* **15:40 - 17:15:** Wait times reached tens of minutes.\n* **17:15 - 19:35:** Returned to degraded wait times, usually under 5 minutes.\n* **19:35 - 19:55:** Wait times again increased to tens of minutes.\n* **19:55:** Fully recovered.\n\n_Mac OS:_\n\n* **12:10 - 15:30:** Degraded wait times, generally under 5 minutes.\n* **15:30 - 21:00:** Wait times escalated to tens of minutes.\n* **21:00:** Fully recovered.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement:\n\nIn response to this incident, we are implementing several key improvements to enhance service reliability. First, we will enhance how tasks are cleared during infrastructure failures, which will help streamline operations. We will put in guardrails in the system to prevent execution of pathological workloads.\n\nAdditionally, we will implement a mechanism that will allow us to temporarily prevent jobs that have failed due to infrastructure issues from being retried. We will adjust Redis health checks by moving them from liveness probes to readiness probes, and we plan to increase the number of Redis shards to better distribute load and minimize the impact of a single shard being blocked. During our investigation we identified a self-reenforcing cycle of poorly performing Redis commands \\(scans\\) that were the root cause of Redis failing, and we’re going to address this as well.\n\nTo enhance stability, we will introduce a timeout for step data based on job maximum runtime and reduce the pressure a single job can place on the S3 connection pool.\n\nWe are also looking to develop a method to pause live deployments from the CircleCI app during incidents, ensuring that delayed changes do not overwrite manual adjustments made in the interim.",

          "body": "## Summary\n\nOn August 1, 2024, from 00:07 UTC to 05:20 UTC, some customers experienced delays when retrieving workflow status, rerunning workflows, and canceling jobs and workflows. This was due to a code change deployed on July 31, 2024, at 12:03 UTC, which modified how workflow status is calculated. At 00:07 UTC on August 1, 2024, specific conditions triggered an unanticipated computational demand, leading to customer impact. After investigating, we identified the issue at 04:55 UTC and reverted the faulty code. Customer impact was fully mitigated around 05:29 UTC. We appreciate our customers' patience and understanding as we worked to resolve this incident.\n\n[The original status page can be found here](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/63xvc5hp49yk).\n\n## What Happened\n\nOn July 31, 2024, at 12:03 UTC, we deployed a change to the workflow status calculation. This change passed all necessary tests to ensure that the correct statuses were calculated. However, it was unknown at the time that, under specific conditions, it could significantly increase computational demand on our system.\n\nApproximately 12 hours later, on August 1, 2024, at 00:07 UTC, these conditions were met, leading to a spike in CPU utilization across our service. As a result, the service scaled up the number of pods, which increased the number of connections used by one of our databases.\n\nAt 01:13 UTC, our database team was alerted to database connection saturation and began an initial investigation. By 02:30 UTC, after identifying the correct service and the extent of customer impact, the responsible engineering team was paged to assist with the issue.\n\nBetween 02:42 UTC and 04:30 UTC, we attempted several mitigation steps to relieve database saturation and reduce CPU utilization, including rolling the pods and reducing the number of replicas. However, these steps did not have the desired effect. At that point, we decided to perform CPU profiling on some of the pods.\n\nThe profiler revealed an issue with the workflow status calculation function, pointing to one of the recently merged commits as the source of the problem. At 04:55 UTC, we reverted that change, and the customer impact ceased around 05:29 UTC.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement\n\nWe made strategic adjustments to our Horizontal Pod Autoscaler \\(HPA\\) settings for the service, ensuring that scaling is better aligned with our database capabilities. This adjustment will further enhance the stability and reliability of the service.\n\nWe have thoroughly analyzed and addressed the underlying performance issue in the workflow status calculation, as well as identified which conditions that could potentially lead to similar issues. To prevent this we have implemented additional tests specifically designed to catch these scenarios. These tests ensure that any changes to workflow status calculation, are rigorously vetted before deployment, reducing the risk of recurrence.\n\nAdditionally,  we have also fine-tuned our monitoring systems to provide earlier notifications to our team in the event of increased latency in our read APIs. This adjustment will enable us to respond more quickly to potential issues, reducing the likelihood of significant customer impact.",

This led to the unavailability of APIs and UI. The issue was resolved by reverting the change in web-ui-v1, restoring Kong routing.\n\n‌\n\n\\*\\*Customer Impact Analysis:\\*\\*\n\nThe incident had a major impact as customers were unable to access any UI or ingest pipelines. An estimated 16.5k pipelines were affected based on traffic data.\n\n‌\n\n\\*\\*Background:\\*\\*\n\nThe incident was related to merging MicroFrontends \\(MFEs\\) in the web-ui-consolidated monorepo. A change in Kong routing led to the breakdown of APIs and UI functionality.\n\n‌\n\n\\*\\*What Happened:\\*\\*\n\nIssues arose due to how Kong handles route priorities, leading to unexpected behavior. The incident was exacerbated by a bug in the Kong router, impacting multiple routes.\n\n‌\n\n\\*\\*Lessons Learned and Future Steps:\\*\\*\n\n* Conduct incident bot testing and improve incident response protocols.\n\n* Investigate route priorities and upgrade Kong for better routing.\n\n* Enhance internal documentation on route priorities to prevent similar incidents.\n\n‌\n\n\\*\\*Timeline:\\*\\*\n\n* 07:35:46 UTC: Customer Impact Start\n\n* 07:39:53 UTC: Initial investigation initiated\n\n* 08:05:45 UTC: Helm Rollback applied, issue resolved\n\n* 08:06:00 UTC: Customer Impact End\n\n* 08:38:00 UTC: Incident End\n\n‌\n\nWe are committed to improving our systems and processes to prevent such incidents in the future",

This was isolated to the UI and had no impact on builds. Both deployments were reverted by 16:27 UTC, but customers who had started workflows between 16:19 and 16:27 continued to see errors until those workflows completed or until an additional change was deployed at 18:27 UTC. We thank our customers for their patience and understanding as we worked to resolve this incident.\n\n## What Happened\n\nAll timestamps are UTC.\n\nCode changes were deployed to two related services at 16:19, which would allow information about actively running workflows to be processed and provided to the UI by the same service that provides information about completed workflows. These changes were made as part of an ongoing effort to improve reliability and performance. The changes involved deployments to a service that processes workflow events, and to the API service that serves that information to the UI, which had been tested via unit and integration tests. The change to process the active running workflow events was thought to have been disabled via a feature flag. At 16:20, the API service deployment failed and was rolled back automatically, and we began to see data type errors in that service as well as in two services related to the UI. We rolled back the deployment of the service that processes the workflow events at 16:27, but the errors continued.\n\nWe first ensured that the rollouts were reverted correctly and that the downstream services related to the UI were not using cached data. At 17:09, we discovered that the feature flag to disable the new event processing had been misconfigured. This led to the processing of events between the deployment at 16:19 and the rollback at 16:27. At 17:14, we identified that the data models had not been fully updated to handle the active workflow data in a backwards-compatible way. The system was attempting to serve data that was not compatible with the API or database spec for the actively running workflows that had been processed. While tests had been written for the initial code change, this particular change in the data had been overlooked. Due to the size of the change, it was also overlooked during code review.\n\nA PR was created to fix the issue in the API service at 17:18, but there were some issues with several tests that needed to be addressed before merging. This took longer than expected due to test complexity. The change was deployed once all tests were passing at 18:27, resolving the issue. We continued to monitor until 19:40 and then declared the incident resolved.\n\n## Future Prevention and Process Improvement\n\nWe have updated the service and the tests to properly account for the differences in data between actively running workflows and completed workflows. It was identified during the incident that the tests for these services were overly complex, which added to the time it took to fully resolve the incident, so we are also prioritizing improvements to the tests. While the API service is now updated to handle the events appropriately, the team responsible for providing the workflow events will also be making changes so that the events for actively running workflows include data for the same fields that completed workflows have.\n\nWe’ve acknowledged that deploying the read and write changes simultaneously created more complexity and added to the size of the pull request for review. We are updating our process to deploy read changes separately from write changes, and to ensure that feature flag functionality is fully documented prior to deployment.\n\nWe also identified that continuing to focus on fixing the tests during the incident added significant delay to mitigating the issue. We intend on sharing these learnings across the organization to encourage incident commanders and responding engineers to be focused on mitigation, and potentially time boxing solutions if other options exist.",
