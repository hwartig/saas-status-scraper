This led to temporary performance degradation and made Miro dashboard and boards unavailable for users.\n\nThe fix was implemented at 07:51 UTC, and the affected users started regaining access to the dashboard and boards. The issue was fully resolved for all users by 08:19 UTC.\n\nThe incident response team already conducted the retrospective and identified the steps they will take to help identify such issues before they start negatively affecting the performance of our product in the future.",
