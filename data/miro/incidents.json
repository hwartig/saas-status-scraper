We also discovered that some customers may have experienced issues with accessing the integration with Google Drive starting from Friday, July 30.\n\nAt 13:23 UTC on August 2 we deployed a fix to restore the app keys, and Google Drive integration became available to all Miro users by 15:07 UTC. We also confirmed that all other integrations were working as expected.\n\nThanks for bearing with us and apologies from our team for the inconvenience caused!",
