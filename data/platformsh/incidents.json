On-call engineers began receiving alerts for multiple sites down and immediately began an investigation.\n\n**What Happened**\n\nA maintenance operation applied to the storage layer unintentionally resulted in degraded performance for most of the grid hosts in the region. The purpose of the maintenance was to improve the storage layer by switching to an upgraded back end but the migration to this new system resulted in elevated CPU resource consumption leading to a major performance impact on any environment running on one of these affected hosts.\n\n**Resolution**\n\nIn order to mitigate the impact of the incident, additional storage layer resources were provisioned and deployed to the region. The migration was able to continue as planned and grid hosts began to recover as expected.\n\n**Impact**\n\nWe have paused this same maintenance across all regions to assess how to safely move forward.",

They verified that environments and console requests were timing out. \n\n**What Happened**\n\nA sudden influx of traffic was identified from several malicious sources. This caused the edge services in the AU and CA-1 regions to experience extremely high load which resulted in connectivity issues with customer environments and consoles.Our engineers confirmed the origin of the attack and took action to mitigate the malicious traffic. Once mitigations were completed, site monitoring reported that the sites were accessible again.\n\n**Resolution**\n\nWe are implementing additional methods to minimise the impacts of this type of attack.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe incident prevented access to all projects in the AU and CA-1 regions. Once mitigations were in place, sites immediately became accessible again and service was restored to normal.  Individual projects experienced unavailability of up to one hour at most. The total length of the incident, including the monitoring period, lasted for 90 minutes.",

This resulted in an inability to process data in a reasonable time in addition to some loss of monitoring data between 16 July 0540 UTC and 16 July 0940 UTC.\n\n**Resolution**\n\n* Additional disk storage was added to the volume.\n* Additional disk monitoring and alerts have been added. \n* A review of the recent code changes is underway to reduce the impact on disk storage.\n\n**Impact**\n\nDuring this incident customers’ dashboards did not display new data. Once the consumer was recovered, live data was ingested in realtime in parallel with the backlog and all available data was up-to-date after approximately 15 hours.",

Platform.sh monitoring detected a number of sites down alerts during the scheduled maintenance, https://status.platform.sh/incidents/vt4zmxmjqdlk - upon further investigation we determined the issue was due to multiple overloaded hosts. We provisioned additional hosts to alleviate the load and rebalanced the environments across these new hosts.\n\nWhat Happened\n\nThe maintenance was performed on the orchestration layer, which included an update to our backup process. \n\nAfter the maintenance, we saw that this updated backup process caused a higher than expected load on an agent running on the hosts there by slowing down the recovery of sites. Plaform.sh technical teams have determined the root cause of high load on the agent, and a fix is being planned for roll-out in the near future.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe incident impacted both production and development environments. Most projects were recovered by 08:09 UTC, with a small portion of projects needing manual recovery by Platform.sh engineers. Observed downtime ranged from 30 minutes to 2 hours.",

Platform.sh monitoring detected a number of site down alerts and upon further investigation determined the issue was a result of maintenance being performed by the upstream service provider.\n\n**What Happened**\n\nThe maintenance performed by the service provider required a reboot of several components in the region that caused production and development environments to become unavailable. The nature of this maintenance was related to routine security patches being rolled out across several hosts in the region.\n\nAfter the reboot, several hosts did not recover as expected and required more intervention by Platform.sh engineers. The faulty hosts were replaced and projects were evacuated across to the good hosts for recovery to take place. A small percentage of projects did not recover as expected during the evacuation which resulted in a longer downtime for those said projects.\n\nPlatform.sh technical teams have fixed the bug that prevented hosts from recovering as expected and the same is being rolled out. Investigation on failures that occurred during evacuation are being carried out and will be fixed appropriately in future.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe incident impacted both production and development environments. Most projects were recovered by 11:53 UTC with a small portion of projects needing manual recovery by Platform.sh engineers. Observed downtime ranged from 60 minutes to 2 hours and 40 minutes.",

There was scheduled maintenance being performed that included a brief outage for every project however this outage lasted longer than expected.\n\nMaintenance announcement: https://status.platform.sh/incidents/scsm9yy84sdy\n\n**What Happened**\n\nAt 19:01 UTC, scheduled maintenance commenced on the region as planned. By 19:50 UTC reports of outages began to arrive. The central coordination layer on the region was affected and as a result several components had to be restarted to bring the services in the region back online. \n\nFurther actions and procedural changes are being made to prevent maintenances from affecting the coordination layer.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe incident impacted all projects on the region. By 21:15 UTC most projects had returned to normal operating levels. The longest observed outage lasted for 1 hour and 30 minutes.",

A mitigation plan to address it was quickly implemented. By 09:12 this traffic volume had been mitigated. We declared an incident to further review the issue and identify the root cause.

Platform.sh monitoring began to see an influx of site down alerts and upon further investigation discovered the issue was originating from the region's storage layer.\n\n**What Happened**\n\nThis was a partial region outage affecting just a portion of hosted projects in the region.\n\nThe region’s storage layer was degraded due to a component of this system becoming overwhelmed and then unavailable. Any project connected to this specific component would have experienced this outage. The service began a self healing process to remedy the failure and by 15:52 UTC this self healing had completed. A post incident investigation has identified the root cause of the component failure and a fix has been made.\n\nAfter the recovery, not all production environments were able to begin serving traffic immediately and required manual intervention by Platform.sh support. Please note that projects that included a MySQL service were impacted by this situation. The MySQL containers did not correctly restart and a connection could not successfully be made to the database container. The support team then handled the necessary repairs on a case by case basis to restore the functionality to these impacted environments that still had not recovered automatically. \n\nThis particular issue regarding the MySQL service has been remedied since this incident occurred. \n\n**Impact**\n\nThe incident was open for 4 hours and 40 minutes. Any project not running a MySQL service would have been restored by 15:52 UTC with an estimated outage of 48 minutes. Any project utilizing a MySQL service would have had a various length of outage time that lasted at a minimum of 48 minutes.",

Earlier that day, scheduled maintenance was performed on the region which led to the unavailability of both production and development environments. This was a partial outage event which only impacted a small portion of projects hosted in the us-2 region.\n\n**What Happened**\n\nThe Platform.sh support team began receiving alerts for several monitored sites which prompted an immediate investigation. Earlier at 09:00 UTC, scheduled maintenance began and upon completion the impacted environments failed to come back online. The issue was identified and a patch has been rolled out to prevent this same issue from happening again in future maintenance for all regions.\n\n**Impact**\n\nBoth production and development environments were impacted and remained unavailable throughout the incident for only the affected projects. \n\nThe total outage lasted for 1 hour and 31 minutes.",
