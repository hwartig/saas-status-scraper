This is because the normal termination signal was not responsive, and our Operations Team had to manually terminate the host.\n\nThis was an abnormal situation and we took this action to try get the sites back up as quickly as possible.\n\nTo prevent such situations in the future we're implementing guidelines to ensure we retain logs when we manually terminate hosts for incidents such as this.",

On-call engineers began receiving alerts for multiple sites down and immediately began an investigation.\n\n**What Happened**\n\nA maintenance operation applied to the storage layer unintentionally resulted in degraded performance for most of the grid hosts in the region. The purpose of the maintenance was to improve the storage layer by switching to an upgraded back end but the migration to this new system resulted in elevated CPU resource consumption leading to a major performance impact on any environment running on one of these affected hosts.\n\n**Resolution**\n\nIn order to mitigate the impact of the incident, additional storage layer resources were provisioned and deployed to the region. The migration was able to continue as planned and grid hosts began to recover as expected.\n\n**Impact**\n\nWe have paused this same maintenance across all regions to assess how to safely move forward.",

They verified that environments and console requests were timing out. \n\n**What Happened**\n\nA sudden influx of traffic was identified from several malicious sources. This caused the edge services in the AU and CA-1 regions to experience extremely high load which resulted in connectivity issues with customer environments and consoles.Our engineers confirmed the origin of the attack and took action to mitigate the malicious traffic. Once mitigations were completed, site monitoring reported that the sites were accessible again.\n\n**Resolution**\n\nWe are implementing additional methods to minimise the impacts of this type of attack.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe incident prevented access to all projects in the AU and CA-1 regions. Once mitigations were in place, sites immediately became accessible again and service was restored to normal.  Individual projects experienced unavailability of up to one hour at most. The total length of the incident, including the monitoring period, lasted for 90 minutes.",

This resulted in an inability to process data in a reasonable time in addition to some loss of monitoring data between 16 July 0540 UTC and 16 July 0940 UTC.\n\n**Resolution**\n\n* Additional disk storage was added to the volume.\n* Additional disk monitoring and alerts have been added. \n* A review of the recent code changes is underway to reduce the impact on disk storage.\n\n**Impact**\n\nDuring this incident customers’ dashboards did not display new data. Once the consumer was recovered, live data was ingested in realtime in parallel with the backlog and all available data was up-to-date after approximately 15 hours.",

Platform.sh monitoring detected a number of sites down alerts during the scheduled maintenance, https://status.platform.sh/incidents/vt4zmxmjqdlk - upon further investigation we determined the issue was due to multiple overloaded hosts. We provisioned additional hosts to alleviate the load and rebalanced the environments across these new hosts.\n\nWhat Happened\n\nThe maintenance was performed on the orchestration layer, which included an update to our backup process. \n\nAfter the maintenance, we saw that this updated backup process caused a higher than expected load on an agent running on the hosts there by slowing down the recovery of sites. Plaform.sh technical teams have determined the root cause of high load on the agent, and a fix is being planned for roll-out in the near future.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe incident impacted both production and development environments. Most projects were recovered by 08:09 UTC, with a small portion of projects needing manual recovery by Platform.sh engineers. Observed downtime ranged from 30 minutes to 2 hours.",
