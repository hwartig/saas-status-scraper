Some sites experienced a number of brief outages during those times.\n\n## **What was done to resolve the incident**\n\nAn additional host was added to the region, and some projects on the overloaded host were migrated to the new host.

As our teams began investigating, the problem disappeared approximately ten minutes later \\(14:56\\) and then reappeared from 15:00 to 15:29. At that point, the system returned to normal operation. Believing the problem to be a transient occurrence, no status page notice was created at that time. The system continued to behave normally until the following day at approximately 13:05 UTC, when the problem reappeared, and we provided the first notice on the status page at 14:05. After further investigation, we determined that the underlying cause was that a data import job that had previously executed in serial fashion had been changed to execute in parallel, and that led to a higher than anticipated load on our accounts system.\n\n# HOW LONG CUSTOMERS WERE IMPACTED\n\nFrom November 1, 2023 14:46 UTC to 14:56 \\(10 minutes\\), November 1, 2023 15:00 to 15:29 \\(29 minutes\\), and November 2 from 13:05 to 16:25 \\(3 hours, 20 minutes\\), for a total of 3 hours, 59 minutes across all occurrences.\n\n# HOW MANY CUSTOMERS WERE IMPACTED\n\nAll projects were subject to the impact. Customer environment availability was not affected by this incident, however access to the user interface, Platform CLI, and API was intermittently unavailable during the times listed above. \n\n# WHAT WAS DONE TO RESOLVE THE INCIDENT\n\nThe data import job was rolled back to the previous, serial version, and the underlying servers were also doubled in size. We are also revamping our incident handling procedures to ensure that more timely notifications of incidents will happen in the future.",

          "body": "### WHAT HAPPENED\n\nOn October 28th at 0725 our internal monitoring notified of a storage alert in the uk-1.platform.sh region. Reviewing the storage usage across all storage hosts in the region, the decision was made to rebalance the storage across the existing hosts without adding more. The alert resolved shortly afterward.\n\nOn October 31st at 0445 UTC the same alert reappeared and our operations team added 3 additional storage hosts to the region. Adding new storage hosts to an existing region requires rebalancing of the data to ensure effective data replication.\n\nDuring investigation it was found that several storage hosts in the region were exhibiting extremely high read activity \\(burst\\), leading to the read/write operations in the region being throttled. This is a limitation of the instance types being used for storage hosts on this provider. These bursts, in addition to the increased read/write activity from the rebalancing operations in the region resulted in slower than normal storage read/write rates to customer projects.\n\nAt 1800 UTC, another three additional storage hosts were added to the region to speed up the rebalance process and reduce the read/write load on the individual hosts. This immediately resolved the throttling and service returned to normal.\n\n### HOW MANY CUSTOMERS WERE IMPACTED\n\nAll projects on the UK-1 region were impacted by this incident across all environments for a period of up to 14 hours. Impact ranged from periods of downtime to slow performance. There was no data lost as a result of this incident.\n\n### WHAT WAS DONE TO RESOLVE THE INCIDENT\n\nThe addition of a further three storage hosts to the region allowed the read/write rates to return to normal levels as the system was able to balance them across more hosts. While we work to optimize the storage daemon to prevent this from reoccuring we have also changed the instance and storage types to a combination with higher read/write rates. Furthermore, we have updated our internal procedures around when to add additional storage hosts to regions to prevent overloading on regions on this infrastructure provider.",

This is because the normal termination signal was not responsive, and our Operations Team had to manually terminate the host.\n\nThis was an abnormal situation and we took this action to try get the sites back up as quickly as possible.\n\nTo prevent such situations in the future we're implementing guidelines to ensure we retain logs when we manually terminate hosts for incidents such as this.",

On-call engineers began receiving alerts for multiple sites down and immediately began an investigation.\n\n**What Happened**\n\nA maintenance operation applied to the storage layer unintentionally resulted in degraded performance for most of the grid hosts in the region. The purpose of the maintenance was to improve the storage layer by switching to an upgraded back end but the migration to this new system resulted in elevated CPU resource consumption leading to a major performance impact on any environment running on one of these affected hosts.\n\n**Resolution**\n\nIn order to mitigate the impact of the incident, additional storage layer resources were provisioned and deployed to the region. The migration was able to continue as planned and grid hosts began to recover as expected.\n\n**Impact**\n\nWe have paused this same maintenance across all regions to assess how to safely move forward.",
