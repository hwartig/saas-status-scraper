This disruption impacted the operational functionality of these projects, leading to degraded service availability.\n\n**Incident Resolution**: To address this issue, we have permanently increased the resource capacity of the incoming request gateway to better handle similar spikes in traffic in the future. Additionally, we have identified the source of the unexpected usage and are implementing measures to prevent a recurrence of this problem.",
