Other affected features that faced intermittent failures are inviting teammates to Jira/Confluence, Jira Service Management helpseeker sign-up using email domain, and creating requests in the Jira portal.\n\n‌\n\nThe event was triggered by a faulty database configuration change, which caused approximately 25% of new login attempts to fail. The Automated Monitoring system detected the incident within five minutes and mitigated it by reverting the database configuration, which put Atlassian systems into a known-good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour and 51 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on August 22 2024, between 17:04 and 18:55 UTC on Jira, Jira Service Management, and Confluence products. The Incident caused service disruption to customers across all regions where the new logins experienced intermittent failures.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a faulty database auto-scaling configuration change. As a result, 25% of the new Atlassian login attempts received HTTP 5xx errors.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the change was related to the system's traffic load. The change reduced the database's autoscaling capacity, which was sufficient for low load conditions, but as traffic increased, the capacity was not enough. The automated testing didn’t load the system enough to detect the issue.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Streamline the login flow such that inviting teammates or helpseeker sign-ups etc are not part of the main workflow;\n* Improve the deployment pipelines such that changes to resources like database can be deployed and tested independent of the code for faster delivery.\n\nFurthermore, we deploy our changes progressively to avoid broad impact. This works well for changes in code, but in this case, the change was to a global resource like database configuration where it gets deployed universally. To minimize the impact of changes to our environments, we will implement additional preventative measures such as:\n\n* Update the testing guidelines so that any database/infrastructure change needs to complete more thorough performance and reliability testing;\n* Fix the dashboards for the traffic monitoring such that they show traffic for correct tables and indices.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The event was triggered by temporarily reduced capacity following a rollback deployment, with insufficient nodes to handle the load. Our alerts detected the incident within two minutes and mitigated it by rolling forward the release and manually adding more nodes, which put Atlassian systems into a known-good state. The total time to resolution was about 64 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on June 04, 2024, between 07:28 and 08:32 UTC, to customers using Confluence Cloud. The Incident caused service disruption to some EU Central region customers, resulting in reduced functionality, slower response times, and limited access when loading Confluence pages, space overview pages, and the home page.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nWhen we deploy and release our changes to all the different regions, we execute a progressive rollout strategy. This helps us catch any issues proactively. If an issue is found during deployment, the deployment is paused and an automated rollback to the previous release is triggered. In this case, there was a timeout from our configuration to our cloud provider for one region, which forced an automated rollback to the previous release in all the regions. As that rollback happened in the EU Central region, there needed to be more compute nodes to handle the high traffic. Other regions rolled back successfully with no customer impact.\n\nThus the root cause of the incident was the failure to scale our nodes to the optimal capacity caused by an automated rollback of a release.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have several testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because it was an issue in our deployment pipeline that was not picked up by our regular automated continuous deployment suites and manual test scripts.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Introduce more aggressive scaling of our nodes to handle incoming traffic if we rollback to an older release\n* Address gaps in deployment and testing processes, add more post-deployment validations to handle these cases\n* Have a fallback to an alternative source when we cannot render the experiences due to these failures\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted by this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The event was triggered by a change to the infrastructure API Gateway, which is responsible for routing the traffic to the correct application backends.\n\nThe incident was detected by the automated monitoring system within five minutes and mitigated by correcting a faulty release feature flag, which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The first communications were published on the Statuspage at 11:11pm UTC. The total time to resolution was about 75 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between 09:43pm and 10:17pm UTC, with the system initially in a degraded state, followed by a total outage between 10:17pm and 10:58pm UTC. \n\n_The Incident caused service disruption to customers in all regions and affected the following products:_\n\n* Jira Software\n* Jira Service Management\n* Jira Work Management\n* Jira Product Discovery\n* Jira Align\n* Confluence\n* Trello\n* Bitbucket\n* Opsgenie\n* Compass\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nA policy used in the infrastructure API gateway was being updated in production via a feature flag. The combination of an erroneous value entered in a feature flag, and a bug in the code resulted in the API Gateway not processing any traffic.\n\nThis created a total outage, where all users started receiving 5XX errors for most Atlassian products.\n\nOnce the problem was identified and the feature flag updated to the correct values, all services started seeing recovery immediately.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have several testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the change did not go through our regular release process and instead was incorrectly applied through a feature flag.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Prevent high-risk feature flags from being used in production\n* Improve the policy changes testing\n* Enforcing longer soak time for policy changes\n* Any feature flags should go through progressive rollouts to minimize broad impact\n* Review the infrastructure feature flags to ensure they all have appropriate defaults\n* Improve our processes and internal tooling to provide faster communications to our customers\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were affected by this incident and are taking immediate steps to address the above gaps.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The event was triggered by a code change that added a dependency on a missing configuration which impacted prod-east customers only. The incident was detected within minutes by automated monitoring and mitigated by enabling a redundancy to remove the impacted service, which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about three hours and 10 minutes, with most customers recovering within one hour.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between March 26, 2024, between 13:22 and 16:33 UTC UTC on Confluence Cloud, with most customers recovering within one hour. \n\nConfluence customers may have experienced reduced functionality, slower response times, and limited access when loading Confluence pages, space overview pages, and the home page.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a code change depending on a missing configuration. After identifying the problem, we quickly reverted the change to mitigate impact to customers.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Introducing improved testing capabilities to prevent similar issues from reaching production environments.\n* Adding enhanced redundancy within the impacted service to improve availability.\n* Adding additional safeguards to prevent missing configurations.\n\n‌\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### Summary\n\nOn February 29, 2024, between 05:11 and 08:46 UTC, customers of Jira Software, Jira Service Management, Jira Work Management, Jira Product Discovery, and Confluence experienced an incorrect data update of Automation Rules. This was due to an incomplete feature flag rollout and bugs in the data upgrade code. 99.99% of affected Automation Rules were remediated by 17:00 UTC on February 29, 2024. The remaining 0.01% of Rule Components were edited by users during the impacted time window and required a confirmation to ensure changes weren’t overridden. These customers were contacted proactively.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nSome Rules containing Issue Edit, Issue Create, or Issue Clone actions in Jira products had the Advanced Fields section removed. These Rules continued to run as if the Advanced Fields section were empty. In addition, for affected Issue Edit actions, Jira notifications were not sent.\n\nSome Rules using the Send Email action in Jira and Confluence had the “From name” field removed. Emails continued to be sent but fell back to the Automation default for the “From name” field.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nWe were in the process of rolling out a new feature for Automation, which required us to perform data upgrades, which could be risky as the current system would run the upgrades automatically upon Rule activity. In an attempt to minimize such risk, we used feature flags to better control when the upgrade occurred.\n\nHowever, there was an error in the feature flag configuration which resulted in the upgrades immediately kicking in. Additionally, there were bugs in these upgrades that resulted in overriding customers' saved values with default values. This incorrect configuration was used for Rule runs until recovery.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTION PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* We are changing the approach for upgrading Rule configurations to allow better testing and prevent accidental upgrades.\n* Improving feature flag rollout and verification processes to avoid such incorrect configurations.\n* Increasing the frequency of backups of the Automation Rule data.\n\nWe apologize to customers who were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the reliability of Automation.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Some apps may have retried and later succeeded these actions, whereas others may have failed the request. The incident was detected within four minutes by automated monitoring of service reliability and mitigated by manual scaling of the service which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about three hours and six minutes.\n\n### **Technical Summary**\n\nOn February 28, 2024, between 12:17 UTC and 15:23 UTC, Jira and Confluence apps built on the Connect platform were unable to perform token exchanges specifically for the purpose of user impersonation requests initiated by the app. The event was triggered by the failure of the oauth-2-authorization-server service to scale as the load increased. The unavailability of this service and apps retrying failing requests created a feedback loop, compounding the impacts of the service not scaling. The problem impacted customers in all regions. The incident was detected within four minutes by automated monitoring of service reliability and mitigated by manual scaling of the service which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about three hours and six minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on February 28, 2024, between 12:17 UTC and 15:23 UTC, and impacted Connect apps for Jira and Confluence products that relied on the user impersonation feature_._ The incident caused service disruption to customers in all regions. Apps that made requests to act on behalf of users would have seen some of their requests failing throughout the incident. Where apps had retry mechanisms in place, these requests may have eventually succeeded once the service was in a good state. Impacted apps received HTTP 502 and 503 errors as well as request timeouts when making requests to the oauth-2-authorization-server service.\n\nProduct functionality such as automation rules in Automation for Jira are partially built on the Connect platform, and some of these were impacted. During the impact window, Automation rules performing rule executions on behalf of a user instead of Automation for Jira failed to authenticate. Rules that failed were recorded in the Automation Audit Log. Additionally, manually triggered rules would have failed to trigger, these will not appear in the Automation Audit Log. Overall, this impacted approximately 2% of all rules run in the impact window. Automation for Confluence was not impacted. \n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an increase in traffic to the oauth-2-authorization-server service in the US-East region and the service not autoscaling in response to the increased load. As the service began to fail requests, apps retried the requests, which further increased the service load. By adding additional processing resources \\(scaling the nodes\\), the service was able to handle the increased load and restore availability. \n\nWhile we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the load conditions had not been encountered previously. The service has operated for many years in its current configuration and has never experienced this particular failure mode where traffic ramped faster than our ability to scale. As such, the scaling controls were not exercised and when required they did not proactively scale the oauth-2-authorization-server service due to the CPU scaling threshold never being reached. \n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* The CPU threshold for scaling the service has been lowered significantly so that scaling will begin much earlier as the service load increases in each region.\n* We are updating our scaling policy to switch to step scaling in order to more rapidly scale capacity if there are significant load increases.\n* We have increased the minimum number of nodes for the service and will monitor service behaviour to see what should be the optimal minimum scaling value.\n* Further analysis of rate limiting being triggered will be undertaken to determine if apps are responding to rate limiting appropriately. The service rate limiting is described in [https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/user-impersonation-for-connect-apps/#rate-limiting](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/user-impersonation-for-connect-apps/#rate-limiting).  \n* Longer-term, network-based rate limiting will be explored to avoid a misbehaving app overloading the service. \n\nWe apologize to customers, partners, and developers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The event was triggered by a change to Atlassian's Network \\(Edge\\) infrastructure, where an incorrect security credential was deployed.  This impacted requests to Atlassian's Cloud originating from the Europe and South Asia regions. The incident was detected within 21 minutes by monitoring and mitigated by a failover to other Edge regions and a rollback of the failed deployment which put Atlassian systems into a known good state.

The detection was delayed because existing testing & monitoring focused on service health rather than the entire system’s availability.\n\nTo prevent a recurrence of this type of incident, we are implementing the following improvement measures:\n\n* Canary checks to monitor the entire system availability.\n* Faster rollback procedures for this type of service impact.\n* Stricter change control procedures for infrastructure modifications.\n* Migration of all DNS records to centralised management and stricter access controls on modification to DNS records.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\n‌\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### Summary\n\nOn February 12, 2024, between 1:45pm and 2:54pm UTC, some Atlassian customers were unable to access Confluence Cloud. The event was triggered by a Redis \\(cache\\) failure causing a spike in the retries to connect to Redis \\(Cache\\). The connection spike along with synching data from multiple nodes to Redis caused the threadpool depletion. This impacted some customers in US East and EU regions. The incident was detected within two minutes by monitoring and mitigated by scaling up the webserver nodes which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour and nine minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on February 12, 2024, between 1:45pm and 2:54pm UTC. This caused service disruption to some customers in US East and EU regions where they were unable to access Confluence.  \n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nConfluence has a set of data controlling features that are stored locally in all nodes, and in a Redis cache as a persistent store. A Redis failover from primary to read replica triggered a process across all nodes to sync data from the local cache to Redis with a large payload. This resulted in spikes in connections with multiple retries resulting in spikes in CPU and threadpool depletion. As a result, Confluence was unavailable or with degraded experience \\(very slow on load\\).\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident.\n\n* Rely on streaming to sync local cache to Redis that prevents connections from being held for a long duration.\n* Increase the Redis instance type from t3.micros to t3.medium that provides a larger memory to accommodate a write-a-storm scenario\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The impact of this incident has been mitigated and our monitoring tools confirm that the success-rate is back to the pre-incident behaviour. It impacted 16 apps according to our logs, where these apps saw a reduced success rate of storage.get API calls, as listed in https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/runtime-reference/storage-api-basic.\n\nAs part of Forge's preparation to support Data Residency, Forge hosted storage has been undergoing a platform and data migration for storing app data. As part of this migration we do comparison checks for data consistency between the old and new platform. The previous incident earlier, https://developer.status.atlassian.com/incidents/9q71ytpjhbtl, had put the data on the new platform out of sync and so comparisons of the data from the old and new platform started showing failures and the migration logic retries on failures to test for consistency issues. This retry behaviour increased latency of these requests which led to 16 apps receiving an increased number of 504 timeout errors. \n\nChecking synchronously was identified by the team as a bug and should have been async. Once the root cause was identified we moved our backing platform rollout to a previous stage. The rollout is split into several stages. The issues we were having were on our blocking stage where we make calls to both the old and new platform and wait for both to complete so we can test any performance issues in the new platform before using it as our source of truth. It was in this blocking stage where we had a bug that included waiting on comparisons when it should've been async.\n\nTo recover, we reverted back to our shadow mode stage. In this stage, all operations to the new platform are asynchronous, including comparisons that were blocking in the other stage and resulted in timeout issues and 504 errors being sent to apps. This is the state that Forge hosted storage has been in for several months without any problems.\n\nHere is the timeline of the impact:\n- On 2024-02-05 at 06:42 PM UTC, impact started with comparisons start happening on out of sync data in blocking mode\n- On 2024-02-05 at 08:57 PM UTC, impact was detected to API by our monitoring systems\n- On 2024-02-05 at 11:34 PM UTC, rollout to new platform was reverted to known stable state and impact ended\n\nWe will release a public incident review, PIR, here in the upcoming weeks for this and the incident that happened earlier, https://developer.status.atlassian.com/incidents/9q71ytpjhbtl. We will detail all that we can about what caused the issue, and what we are doing to prevent it from happening again.\n\nWe apologise for any inconveniences this may have caused our customers and the developer community and committed to preventing further issues with our hosted storage capability.",

The event was triggered by a deployment of a downstream dependency service which could not scale with the increase in traffic. The incident was detected within 18 minutes by an automated monitoring system and mitigated by scaling out nodes manually which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour. \n\nIn response to this incident, we helped scale the service and put in a deployment block with the goal of preventing the service from being deployed to production again until the issue was resolved. \n\nOn January 25, 2024, between 01:05 am UTC and 01:42 am UTC, a separate automated deployment process ran to deploy services that were not deployed in the previous seven days. This deployment also caused the dependent service to run at a lower-than-desired capacity, resulting in degraded performance in Confluence. The issue was detected within 10 minutes by an automated monitoring system and mitigated by scaling out nodes manually. The total time to resolution was about 37 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on January 18, 2024, between 01:12 am UTC and 02:12 am UTC, and then on January 25, 2024, between 01:05 am UTC and  01:42 am UTC. These incidents caused service disruption to customers in the APAC region where they may have noticed timeouts and failed requests for viewing pages, creating pages, and other functionality of Confluence Cloud.  \n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a deployment of a downstream service that had not scaled to meet the growing traffic. As a result, Confluence Cloud saw timeouts and errors in their requests and the users received HTTP 500 errors. \n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\n‌\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident.\n\n* Ensure the right capacity for the target service pool during deployment.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### Summary\n\nOn January 18, 2024, between 01:12 am UTC and 02:12 am UTC, Atlassian customers using Confluence Cloud were unable to access core product functionality, seeing degraded performance in the APAC region. The event was triggered by a deployment of a downstream dependency service which could not scale with the increase in traffic. The incident was detected within 18 minutes by an automated monitoring system and mitigated by scaling out nodes manually which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour. \n\nIn response to this incident, we helped scale the service and put in a deployment block with the goal of preventing the service from being deployed to production again until the issue was resolved. \n\nOn January 25, 2024, between 01:05 am UTC and 01:42 am UTC, a separate automated deployment process ran to deploy services that were not deployed in the previous seven days. This deployment also caused the dependent service to run at a lower-than-desired capacity, resulting in degraded performance in Confluence. The issue was detected within 10 minutes by an automated monitoring system and mitigated by scaling out nodes manually. The total time to resolution was about 37 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on January 18, 2024, between 01:12 am UTC and 02:12 am UTC, and then on January 25, 2024, between 01:05 am UTC and  01:42 am UTC. These incidents caused service disruption to customers in the APAC region where they may have noticed timeouts and failed requests for viewing pages, creating pages, and other functionality of Confluence Cloud.  \n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a deployment of a downstream service that had not scaled to meet the growing traffic. As a result, Confluence Cloud saw timeouts and errors in their requests and the users received HTTP 500 errors. \n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\n‌\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident.\n\n* Ensure the right capacity for the target service pool during deployment.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Customers' user search results failed or were delayed as Atlassian's service returning user search results was degraded in several regions.\n\nThe incident originated from a computationally intensive operation that was triggered multiple times in rapid succession, resulting in degraded performance of Atlassian's user search service across several regions. Notably, customers in the EU west region were most affected. The incident was detected within 2 minutes by automated monitoring, and our team promptly took action by recovering unhealthy systems and scaling up the service's infrastructure temporarily. The resolution process concluded in 3 hours and 06 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between Dec 18, 2023, between 12:29 p.m. UTC and Dec 18, 2023, 3:35 p.m. UTC. The Incident caused service disruption to cloud customers worldwide. Customers experienced delayed or failed user searches when using the following Atlassian cloud products:\n\n* Atlas\n* Bitbucket Cloud\n* Compass\n* Confluence Cloud\n* Jira Service Management\n* Jira Software\n* Jira Work Management\n* Jira Product Discovery\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident stemmed from Atlassian's user search service receiving commands to process multiple computationally intensive operations in rapid succession. These operations were directed at the same customer data set, and therefore overloaded resources within a clustered database system, leading to memory exhaustion and subsequent unresponsiveness to user search requests. \n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nTo prevent a recurrence of such incidents, we are implementing the following measures:\n\n* Implement a mechanism to queue computationally intensive operations in order to avoid overloading the resources within the systems and process them without impact on customer experience.\n* Fine-tune our clustered database settings to mitigate the impact of resource exhaustion on the overall system. \n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were affected during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the service’s resiliency.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The root cause was a feature update on the editor that caused issues during page editing where inputting characters results in double entries and/or the cursor to shift unexpectedly. We have deployed a fix to mitigate the issue and have verified that the services have recovered. The conditions that cause the bug have been addressed and we’re actively working on a permanent fix. The issue has been resolved and the service is operating normally.",
