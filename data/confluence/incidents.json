The event was triggered by a code change that added a dependency on a missing configuration which impacted prod-east customers only. The incident was detected within minutes by automated monitoring and mitigated by enabling a redundancy to remove the impacted service, which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about three hours and 10 minutes, with most customers recovering within one hour.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between March 26, 2024, between 13:22 and 16:33 UTC UTC on Confluence Cloud, with most customers recovering within one hour. \n\nConfluence customers may have experienced reduced functionality, slower response times, and limited access when loading Confluence pages, space overview pages, and the home page.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a code change depending on a missing configuration. After identifying the problem, we quickly reverted the change to mitigate impact to customers.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Introducing improved testing capabilities to prevent similar issues from reaching production environments.\n* Adding enhanced redundancy within the impacted service to improve availability.\n* Adding additional safeguards to prevent missing configurations.\n\n‌\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### Summary\n\nOn February 29, 2024, between 05:11 and 08:46 UTC, customers of Jira Software, Jira Service Management, Jira Work Management, Jira Product Discovery, and Confluence experienced an incorrect data update of Automation Rules. This was due to an incomplete feature flag rollout and bugs in the data upgrade code. 99.99% of affected Automation Rules were remediated by 17:00 UTC on February 29, 2024. The remaining 0.01% of Rule Components were edited by users during the impacted time window and required a confirmation to ensure changes weren’t overridden. These customers were contacted proactively.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nSome Rules containing Issue Edit, Issue Create, or Issue Clone actions in Jira products had the Advanced Fields section removed. These Rules continued to run as if the Advanced Fields section were empty. In addition, for affected Issue Edit actions, Jira notifications were not sent.\n\nSome Rules using the Send Email action in Jira and Confluence had the “From name” field removed. Emails continued to be sent but fell back to the Automation default for the “From name” field.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nWe were in the process of rolling out a new feature for Automation, which required us to perform data upgrades, which could be risky as the current system would run the upgrades automatically upon Rule activity. In an attempt to minimize such risk, we used feature flags to better control when the upgrade occurred.\n\nHowever, there was an error in the feature flag configuration which resulted in the upgrades immediately kicking in. Additionally, there were bugs in these upgrades that resulted in overriding customers' saved values with default values. This incorrect configuration was used for Rule runs until recovery.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTION PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* We are changing the approach for upgrading Rule configurations to allow better testing and prevent accidental upgrades.\n* Improving feature flag rollout and verification processes to avoid such incorrect configurations.\n* Increasing the frequency of backups of the Automation Rule data.\n\nWe apologize to customers who were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the reliability of Automation.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### Summary\n\nOn February 28, 2024, between 12:17 UTC and 15:23 UTC, Jira and Confluence apps built on the Connect platform were unable to perform any actions on behalf of users. Some apps may have retried and later succeeded these actions, whereas others may have failed the request. The incident was detected within four minutes by automated monitoring of service reliability and mitigated by manual scaling of the service which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about three hours and six minutes.\n\n### **Technical Summary**\n\nOn February 28, 2024, between 12:17 UTC and 15:23 UTC, Jira and Confluence apps built on the Connect platform were unable to perform token exchanges specifically for the purpose of user impersonation requests initiated by the app. The event was triggered by the failure of the oauth-2-authorization-server service to scale as the load increased. The unavailability of this service and apps retrying failing requests created a feedback loop, compounding the impacts of the service not scaling. The problem impacted customers in all regions. The incident was detected within four minutes by automated monitoring of service reliability and mitigated by manual scaling of the service which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about three hours and six minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on February 28, 2024, between 12:17 UTC and 15:23 UTC, and impacted Connect apps for Jira and Confluence products that relied on the user impersonation feature_._ The incident caused service disruption to customers in all regions. Apps that made requests to act on behalf of users would have seen some of their requests failing throughout the incident. Where apps had retry mechanisms in place, these requests may have eventually succeeded once the service was in a good state. Impacted apps received HTTP 502 and 503 errors as well as request timeouts when making requests to the oauth-2-authorization-server service.\n\nProduct functionality such as automation rules in Automation for Jira are partially built on the Connect platform, and some of these were impacted. During the impact window, Automation rules performing rule executions on behalf of a user instead of Automation for Jira failed to authenticate. Rules that failed were recorded in the Automation Audit Log. Additionally, manually triggered rules would have failed to trigger, these will not appear in the Automation Audit Log. Overall, this impacted approximately 2% of all rules run in the impact window. Automation for Confluence was not impacted. \n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an increase in traffic to the oauth-2-authorization-server service in the US-East region and the service not autoscaling in response to the increased load. As the service began to fail requests, apps retried the requests, which further increased the service load. By adding additional processing resources \\(scaling the nodes\\), the service was able to handle the increased load and restore availability. \n\nWhile we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the load conditions had not been encountered previously. The service has operated for many years in its current configuration and has never experienced this particular failure mode where traffic ramped faster than our ability to scale. As such, the scaling controls were not exercised and when required they did not proactively scale the oauth-2-authorization-server service due to the CPU scaling threshold never being reached. \n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* The CPU threshold for scaling the service has been lowered significantly so that scaling will begin much earlier as the service load increases in each region.\n* We are updating our scaling policy to switch to step scaling in order to more rapidly scale capacity if there are significant load increases.\n* We have increased the minimum number of nodes for the service and will monitor service behaviour to see what should be the optimal minimum scaling value.\n* Further analysis of rate limiting being triggered will be undertaken to determine if apps are responding to rate limiting appropriately. The service rate limiting is described in [https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/user-impersonation-for-connect-apps/#rate-limiting](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/user-impersonation-for-connect-apps/#rate-limiting).  \n* Longer-term, network-based rate limiting will be explored to avoid a misbehaving app overloading the service. \n\nWe apologize to customers, partners, and developers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The event was triggered by a change to Atlassian's Network \\(Edge\\) infrastructure, where an incorrect security credential was deployed.  This impacted requests to Atlassian's Cloud originating from the Europe and South Asia regions. The incident was detected within 21 minutes by monitoring and mitigated by a failover to other Edge regions and a rollback of the failed deployment which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe failed change impacted 3 out of the 14 Atlassian Cloud regions \\(Europe/Frankfort, Europe/Dublin, and India/Mumbai\\). Between 21/02/2023 2:30am and 04:15am UTC, end-users may have experience intermittent errors or complete service disruption for multiple Cloud products. As the traffic is directed to Atlassian Cloud using DNS latency-based records, only the traffic originating from locations close to Europe and India was impacted.   \n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nA change to our Network Infrastructure used faulty credentials. As a result, customer authentication requests could not be validated, and requests were returned with a 500 or 503 errors. After investigation, it was found that the health-check and tests which should have prevented the faulty credentials to reach the production environment, contained a bug and never indicating a fault.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified in our dev and staging environments because the new credentials were only valid for production.  \n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Improving end-to-end healthchecks\n* Faster rollback of our infrastructure deployment\n* Improved monitoring\n\nFurthermore, we deploy our changes progressively \\(by cloud region\\) to avoid broad impact but in this case, our detection and health-checks did not work as expected. To minimise the impact of breaking changes to our environments, we will implement additional preventative measures such as:\n\n* Canary and shakedown deployments with automated rollback\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The connection spike along with synching data from multiple nodes to Redis caused the threadpool depletion. This impacted some customers in US East and EU regions. The incident was detected within two minutes by monitoring and mitigated by scaling up the webserver nodes which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour and nine minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on February 12, 2024, between 1:45pm and 2:54pm UTC. This caused service disruption to some customers in US East and EU regions where they were unable to access Confluence.  \n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nConfluence has a set of data controlling features that are stored locally in all nodes, and in a Redis cache as a persistent store. A Redis failover from primary to read replica triggered a process across all nodes to sync data from the local cache to Redis with a large payload. This resulted in spikes in connections with multiple retries resulting in spikes in CPU and threadpool depletion. As a result, Confluence was unavailable or with degraded experience \\(very slow on load\\).\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident.\n\n* Rely on streaming to sync local cache to Redis that prevents connections from being held for a long duration.\n* Increase the Redis instance type from t3.micros to t3.medium that provides a larger memory to accommodate a write-a-storm scenario\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The impact of this incident has been mitigated and our monitoring tools confirm that the success-rate is back to the pre-incident behaviour. It impacted 16 apps according to our logs, where these apps saw a reduced success rate of storage.get API calls, as listed in https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/runtime-reference/storage-api-basic.\n\nAs part of Forge's preparation to support Data Residency, Forge hosted storage has been undergoing a platform and data migration for storing app data. As part of this migration we do comparison checks for data consistency between the old and new platform. The previous incident earlier, https://developer.status.atlassian.com/incidents/9q71ytpjhbtl, had put the data on the new platform out of sync and so comparisons of the data from the old and new platform started showing failures and the migration logic retries on failures to test for consistency issues. This retry behaviour increased latency of these requests which led to 16 apps receiving an increased number of 504 timeout errors. \n\nChecking synchronously was identified by the team as a bug and should have been async. Once the root cause was identified we moved our backing platform rollout to a previous stage. The rollout is split into several stages. The issues we were having were on our blocking stage where we make calls to both the old and new platform and wait for both to complete so we can test any performance issues in the new platform before using it as our source of truth. It was in this blocking stage where we had a bug that included waiting on comparisons when it should've been async.\n\nTo recover, we reverted back to our shadow mode stage. In this stage, all operations to the new platform are asynchronous, including comparisons that were blocking in the other stage and resulted in timeout issues and 504 errors being sent to apps. This is the state that Forge hosted storage has been in for several months without any problems.\n\nHere is the timeline of the impact:\n- On 2024-02-05 at 06:42 PM UTC, impact started with comparisons start happening on out of sync data in blocking mode\n- On 2024-02-05 at 08:57 PM UTC, impact was detected to API by our monitoring systems\n- On 2024-02-05 at 11:34 PM UTC, rollout to new platform was reverted to known stable state and impact ended\n\nWe will release a public incident review, PIR, here in the upcoming weeks for this and the incident that happened earlier, https://developer.status.atlassian.com/incidents/9q71ytpjhbtl. We will detail all that we can about what caused the issue, and what we are doing to prevent it from happening again.\n\nWe apologise for any inconveniences this may have caused our customers and the developer community and committed to preventing further issues with our hosted storage capability.",

          "body": "### Summary\n\nOn January 18, 2024, between 01:12 am UTC and 02:12 am UTC, Atlassian customers using Confluence Cloud were unable to access core product functionality, seeing degraded performance in the APAC region. The event was triggered by a deployment of a downstream dependency service which could not scale with the increase in traffic. The incident was detected within 18 minutes by an automated monitoring system and mitigated by scaling out nodes manually which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour. \n\nIn response to this incident, we helped scale the service and put in a deployment block with the goal of preventing the service from being deployed to production again until the issue was resolved. \n\nOn January 25, 2024, between 01:05 am UTC and 01:42 am UTC, a separate automated deployment process ran to deploy services that were not deployed in the previous seven days. This deployment also caused the dependent service to run at a lower-than-desired capacity, resulting in degraded performance in Confluence. The issue was detected within 10 minutes by an automated monitoring system and mitigated by scaling out nodes manually. The total time to resolution was about 37 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on January 18, 2024, between 01:12 am UTC and 02:12 am UTC, and then on January 25, 2024, between 01:05 am UTC and  01:42 am UTC. These incidents caused service disruption to customers in the APAC region where they may have noticed timeouts and failed requests for viewing pages, creating pages, and other functionality of Confluence Cloud.  \n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a deployment of a downstream service that had not scaled to meet the growing traffic. As a result, Confluence Cloud saw timeouts and errors in their requests and the users received HTTP 500 errors. \n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\n‌\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident.\n\n* Ensure the right capacity for the target service pool during deployment.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The event was triggered by a deployment of a downstream dependency service which could not scale with the increase in traffic. The incident was detected within 18 minutes by an automated monitoring system and mitigated by scaling out nodes manually which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour. \n\nIn response to this incident, we helped scale the service and put in a deployment block with the goal of preventing the service from being deployed to production again until the issue was resolved. \n\nOn January 25, 2024, between 01:05 am UTC and 01:42 am UTC, a separate automated deployment process ran to deploy services that were not deployed in the previous seven days. This deployment also caused the dependent service to run at a lower-than-desired capacity, resulting in degraded performance in Confluence. The issue was detected within 10 minutes by an automated monitoring system and mitigated by scaling out nodes manually. The total time to resolution was about 37 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on January 18, 2024, between 01:12 am UTC and 02:12 am UTC, and then on January 25, 2024, between 01:05 am UTC and  01:42 am UTC. These incidents caused service disruption to customers in the APAC region where they may have noticed timeouts and failed requests for viewing pages, creating pages, and other functionality of Confluence Cloud.  \n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a deployment of a downstream service that had not scaled to meet the growing traffic. As a result, Confluence Cloud saw timeouts and errors in their requests and the users received HTTP 500 errors. \n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\n‌\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident.\n\n* Ensure the right capacity for the target service pool during deployment.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Customers' user search results failed or were delayed as Atlassian's service returning user search results was degraded in several regions.\n\nThe incident originated from a computationally intensive operation that was triggered multiple times in rapid succession, resulting in degraded performance of Atlassian's user search service across several regions. Notably, customers in the EU west region were most affected. The incident was detected within 2 minutes by automated monitoring, and our team promptly took action by recovering unhealthy systems and scaling up the service's infrastructure temporarily. The resolution process concluded in 3 hours and 06 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between Dec 18, 2023, between 12:29 p.m. UTC and Dec 18, 2023, 3:35 p.m. UTC. The Incident caused service disruption to cloud customers worldwide. Customers experienced delayed or failed user searches when using the following Atlassian cloud products:\n\n* Atlas\n* Bitbucket Cloud\n* Compass\n* Confluence Cloud\n* Jira Service Management\n* Jira Software\n* Jira Work Management\n* Jira Product Discovery\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident stemmed from Atlassian's user search service receiving commands to process multiple computationally intensive operations in rapid succession. These operations were directed at the same customer data set, and therefore overloaded resources within a clustered database system, leading to memory exhaustion and subsequent unresponsiveness to user search requests. \n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nTo prevent a recurrence of such incidents, we are implementing the following measures:\n\n* Implement a mechanism to queue computationally intensive operations in order to avoid overloading the resources within the systems and process them without impact on customer experience.\n* Fine-tune our clustered database settings to mitigate the impact of resource exhaustion on the overall system. \n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were affected during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the service’s resiliency.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nBetween September 18 2023 5:47 PM UTC and September 19 2023 04:15 AM UTC, customers using Confluence Cloud, Jira Software, Jira Service Management, Jira Work Management, Jira Product Discovery and Trello products with services hosted in the AWS us-east-1 and us-west-2 region experienced slow performance and/or page load failures as a result of an AWS issue that began on September 18 2023, 4:00 PM UTC.\n\nThis was triggered by an underlying networking fault in our cloud provider AWS, which affected multiple AWS services in their us-west-2 and us-east-1 regions, used by Atlassian. The incident was detected within one minute by our monitoring systems. Recovery of affected Atlassian services occurred on a product-by-product basis with full recovery for all products completed by September 19 2023 04:15 AM UTC.\n\n‌\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nProduct impact varied based on which regions and availability zones services are using, with services hosted in us-west-2 being affected more than services hosted in us-east-1.  \n\nProduct-specific impacts are listed below:\n\n* **Jira Software -** A number of Jira nodes were affected with highly elevated error rates due to Jira databases in us-east-1 and us-west-2 being impacted.  The impact was varied with some Jira nodes being unusable whilst others were in a usable but degraded state.\n* **Jira Service Management -** Some users hosted in us-east-1 and us-west-2 experienced problems when creating issues through the Help Center, viewing issues, transitioning issues, posting comments and using queues\n* **Jira Work Management -** Users based in us-west-2 experienced minor service degradation.\n* **Jira Product Discovery -** Users experienced some issues when loading insights.\n* **Confluence Cloud -** Impact was limited to customers hosted in the us-west-2 region. During this time, users attempting to load confluence pages experienced sporadic product degradation, including brief periods where Confluence was inaccessible, complete and partial page load failures, page timeouts, increased request latency.\n* **Trello -** Users had minimal service degradation - only 0.1% of Trello users had automation rules impacted.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe root cause was an issue with subsystem responsible for network mapping propagation within the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud in the us-east-1 \\(use1-az1\\) and us-west-2 \\(usw2-az1 and usw2-az2\\) regions, which impacted network connectivity for multiple AWS services which Atlassian products rely upon.\n\nThere was a delay between the AWS incident and Atlassian being affected as existing compute instances and resources were not affected by the issue. However any changes to networking state - such as scaling-up with additional compute nodes - experienced delays in the propagation of network mappings. This led to network connectivity issues until these network mappings had been fully propagated. Other AWS services that create or modify networking resources also saw impact as a result of this issue.\n\nThere were no relevant Atlassian-driven events in the lead-up that have been identified to cause or contribute to this incident.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nTo avoid repeating this type of incident, we are prioritizing documenting and evaluating ways to improve Availability Zone failure resiliency.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Although the incident was detected within one minute by our monitoring system, this issue led to the degradation of the scaling capabilities of our internal hosting platform, resulting in service degradation or outages for customers of Atlassian cloud products.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThis incident affected multiple regions and products, due to the diminished scaling capabilities of our internal hosting platform. Customers using Atlassian cloud products faced reduced functionality, slower response times, and limited access to specific features.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe root cause of this incident was unexpected behavior in a third-party tool that functions as our internal artifact management system. The issue made it impossible for our artifact management system to scale to demand, and as a result, our internal hosting platform was unable to scale effectively.\n\nUpon identifying and localizing the problem, we corrected the issue and were able to restore full scaling capabilities to our artifact management system, and by extension, our internal hosting platform.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nFollowing a previous incident of this nature \\([https://jira-software.status.atlassian.com/incidents/pqltf5m971qf](https://jira-software.status.atlassian.com/incidents/pqltf5m971qf)\\), we prioritized a project to ensure that such downtime does not negatively impact the ability to scale for our other components nor cause customer impact. While this work is now complete, it was not quite ready at the time this incident occurred.\n\nFurther, we committed to a temporary freeze on non-critical upgrades and changes for the artifact management system. This freeze has been maintained - the issue in this instance was not the result of a change or upgrade, but rather an unforeseen behavior in the system.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience caused by this incident and appreciate your understanding. Our team is dedicated to continually improving our systems and processes to provide you with the exceptional service you deserve. Thank you for your continued support and trust in us.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The event was triggered by a misconfiguration of rate limits in an internal service which caused a cascading failure in sign-in and signup-related APIs. The incident was quickly detected by multiple automated monitoring systems. The incident was mitigated on Sep 13, 2023, 03: 30 PM UTC by the rollback of a feature and additional scaling of services which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 3 hours & 30 minutes.\n\n‌\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between Sep 13, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC and Sep 13, 2023, 03: 30 PM UTC on multiple products. The Incident caused intermittent service disruption across all regions. Some users were unable to sign in for sessions. Other scenarios that temporarily failed were new user signups, profile retrieval, and password reset. During the incident we had a peak of 90% requests failing across authentication, user profile retrieval, and password reset use cases.\n\n‌\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused due to a misconfiguration of a rate limit in an internal core service. As a result, some sign-in requests over the limit received HTTP 429 errors. However, retry behavior for requests caused a multiplication of load which led to higher service degradation. As many internal services depend on each other, the call graph complexity led to a longer time to detect the actual faulty service.\n\n‌\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are continuously improving our system's resiliency.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Audit and improve service rate limits and client retry and backoff behavior.\n* Improve scale and load test automation for complex service interactions.\n* Audit cross-service dependencies and minimize them where possible related to sign-in flows.\n\n‌\n\nDue to the unavailability of sign-in, some customers were unable to create support tickets.

Users with existing sessions were not impacted.\n\nBetween 5:32 and 6:00 UTC, traffic was incrementally restored to a previous build, mitigating the impact for users.\n\nThe total time to resolution was one hour and 53 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nUsers were not able to login using Atlassian's shared account management system \\([id.atlassian.com](http://id.atlassian.com)\\).\n\nThis affected users who were trying to login to the following products: Jira, Confluence, Trello, Opsgenie, mobile apps and ecosystem apps.\n\nAside from the inability to login, there was no impact on other Atlassian products or features.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nMultiple Set-Cookie headers were unintentionally modified so that only the last Set-Cookie header remained in the response to user's browsers.  The issue was caused by a change to Network Extensions within the Edge Network. As a result, users that needed a new session could not login.  Upon login, the users were redirected to login again and no session was created for them.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue was not detected in Atlassian's staging environment.  End-to-end tests did not cover the use case of multiple Set-Cookie headers in the single response and therefore this bug went unnoticed.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Automated tests to be put in place to validate that cookies are not being removed from responses.\n* Configuration of networking extensions will be guaranteed to be identical in staging and production to ensure errors are picked up earlier.\n\nFurthermore, we typically deploy our changes progressively by cloud region to avoid broad impact, but in this case, the change was not deemed risky and was deployed to all regions. To minimize the impact of breaking changes to our environments, we will implement additional preventative measures:\n\n* Changes to network extensions in the future will use progressive rollouts.\n* With staging being properly utilized, errors similar to this one will not be deployed to any production environments.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
