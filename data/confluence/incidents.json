          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn January 20, 2023, between 08:57 AM and 09:29 AM UTC, Atlassian customers using Confluence Cloud couldn’t access their Confluence sites. The event was triggered by thread depletion in some of the GraphQL nodes in the Europe \\(Frankfurt\\) region. Our system automatically stopped sending requests to these unhealthy nodes but then overloaded the rest of the healthy nodes. The remaining nodes experienced high CPU, slow response time, and high error rates, which in turn rendered Confluence sites unresponsive.\n\nThe incident impacted customers in the Europe \\(Frankfurt\\) region. It was detected within seven minutes by the GraphQL high CPU detection system and mitigated by aggressively scaling up the service in that region, which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was 32 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on January 20, 2023, between 08:57 AM UTC and 09:29 AM UTC for Confluence Cloud products. The incident caused service disruption to customers in the Europe \\(Frankfurt\\) region.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by thread pool depletion in some of Confluence’s GraphQL nodes. The thread pool depletion was triggered by a code change in GraphQL, which fetches authorization tokens from our authorization service using async threads meant to improve performance. Confluence’s GraphQL service recently switched to using a thread pool to handle all token fetch operations. During the incident, Confluence’s authorization service experienced spikes in new connections and returned timeout errors when the GraphQL service tried to fetch tokens. Since these fetches were executed in a thread pool, we ended up with thread pool depletion on our GraphQL service, making some of the nodes unresponsive.\n\nWhile our system automatically rotated the unhealthy nodes out of service and replaced them with new nodes, the ongoing traffic overloaded the remaining healthy nodes, which then rendered the remaining healthy nodes unresponsive.\n\nThe faulty service is a GraphQL gateway service to all Confluence Cloud API traffic. Since all the nodes were either not serving traffic or too overloaded to serve traffic, many of the GraphQL requests failed and rendered Confluence Cloud in the region inaccessible.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe appreciate outages impact your productivity and apologize to our partners and customers whose services were impacted during this incident. We are taking immediate steps to avoid a similar situation and improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nWhile we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place to avoid this type of situation, this specific issue was triggered only under particular load conditions when the authorization service fails to respond to token fetch requests and when the majority of the GraphQL nodes experience thread depletion.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following actions to avoid this type of incident in the future:\n\n* Turn off the async token fetch immediately\n* Look into faster automatic node replacement when nodes are unhealthy\n* Audit GraphQL and authorization services to confirm they can handle increasing loads in different regions\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn January 13, 2023, between 00:27 and 01:25 UTC, Atlassian customers using Confluence Cloud couldn’t access their Confluence sites. The event was triggered by a bug in the GraphQL service deploy script. The bug caused the script to fetch the wrong configuration file version, which is incompatible with the application code, and caused the service to fail when responding to all the incoming API requests with authentication errors.\n\nThe incident impacted customers in U.S. West \\(N. California\\), Europe \\(Frankfurt\\), and Asia Pacific \\(Singapore\\) regions. The incident was detected within 3 minutes by the frontend error detection system and mitigated by rolling back the last deployment of our GraphQL service, which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was 58 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between January 13, 2023, between 00:27am UTC and January 13, 2023, 01:25 AM UTC on Confluence Cloud products. The incident caused service disruption to customers in the U.S. West \\(N. California\\), Europe \\(Frankfurt\\), and Asia Pacific \\(Singapore\\) regions.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a bug in the GraphQL service deploy script. As a precaution, GraphQL service’s code changes have to be soaked in our staging environment before they are released to production. On the day of a production release, the GraphQL team will select a commit that has been soaked enough time to release.\n\nThere is a bug in the deploy script so that while the application source code is deployed per the commit the team chooses to release, the configuration file is fetched from the latest commit by the script. The latest configuration file change was incompatible with the application code and caused the service to fail when responding to all incoming API requests with authentication errors.\n\nThe faulty service is a GraphQL gateway service to all Confluence Cloud API traffic. Since it throws 401 errors for all the requests, all the GraphQL requests fail and hence render Confluence Cloud in the regions deployed inaccessible.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe appreciate outages impact your productivity. We apologize to our partners and customers whose services were impacted during this incident, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nWhile we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place to avoid this type of situation, this specific bug wasn’t discovered because it’s rare the service has a configuration file change that is not backward compatible with the code. A combination of the bug in the deploy script and the non-backward-compatible configuration file change caused this problem in production.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid this type of incident in the future:\n\n* Fix the bug in the deploy script so that the configuration file will be fetched together with the application code to ensure they are always compatible with each other\n* Update the on-call runbook and continue to train on-call engineers on how to perform a quick rollback on faulty service to minimize the incident time\n* Audit all the Confluence Cloud microservices to confirm every microservice deployed has the correct anomaly detection and progressive rollout setup\n\nFurthermore, we deploy our changes progressively \\(by percentage and each region\\) to avoid a broad impact but in this case, our error rate detection did not work as expected. To minimize the impact of breaking changes to our environments, we will implement additional preventative measures such as:\n\n* Bolster error detection mechanisms on the outer HTTP layer. We currently have error detector in the GraphQL layer but this time the request failed in the HTTP layer without reaching the GraphQL request handling. We need both types of detectors to cover different scenarios.\n* Bolster deployment validation to verify core functionalities of GraphQL during deployment so that deployment will be immediately halted and rolled back if the validation fails.\n\nThank you to your continued support.\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **CONTEXT**\n\nAtlassian Cloud products, applications, the customer experiences they provide, as well as supporting services and Atlassian’s own internal tooling rely on compute and data workloads deployed in Amazon Web Services \\(AWS\\) Virtual Private Cloud \\(VPC\\).\n\nCritical to the function of these applications is the network communication between them, as well as to the Internet and AWS-managed services. This communication depends on DNS resolution, which applications perform by querying a DNS server to translate service names into network addresses they can connect to.\n\nTo facilitate DNS resolution across multiple accounts and VPCs, Atlassian operates [centralized EC2 \\(Elastic Compute Cloud\\) DNS servers](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-centralize-dns-management-in-a-multi-account-environment/) in each AWS region we serve customers from.\n\nAtlassian is currently in the process of migrating from this centralized infrastructure to a more resilient distributed solution that leverages [AWS-managed VPC resolver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#AmazonDNS) in a [Shared VPC architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9NMA3ACZDM). However, a number of internal applications and services still rely on the EC2-based solution.\n\nThe EC2-based DNS servers utilize [security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html), which are subject to [connection tracking allowance limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html)instrumented by AWS.\n\n### **INCIDENT SUMMARY**\n\nOn November 22, 2022, between 19:39 and 21:28 UTC, some Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket customers experienced varying levels of degradation across our products and services, including partner apps and integrations. The incident was detected within nine minutes by an automated monitoring system and resolved within one hour and 49 minutes.\n\nThe event was triggered by Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure within the AWS us-east-1 region encountering a network connection tracking allowance limit. Despite the fault being localized to one region, there was a global impact for customers whose data resided in us-east-1, as well as Atlassian products which have unique dependencies on that region.\n\nThe issue was initially mitigated by scaling up the DNS infrastructure, which increased the connection tracking allowance limit and returned Atlassian products to a healthy state. The underlying issue has since been resolved by a configuration change and cannot reoccur.\n\nThe incident was not caused by an attack and it was not a security issue. Atlassian customer data remains secure.\n\nWe deeply value the trust placed in Atlassian and apologize to customers who were affected by the event.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe impact occurred on November 22, 2022, between 19:39 and 21:28 UTC, for a total of one hour and 49 minutes. Some Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket customers experienced service degradation ranging from intermittent access to a complete outage. Customers experienced error pages or very slow responses in applications and browsers, as well as 5xx response codes from our APIs.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident occurred as connections through Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure reached a new daily peak due to steady traffic growth. As a result, [a limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#connection-tracking-throttling) on the number of simultaneous network connections [tracked by an AWS EC2 security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html) was encountered. Upon reaching this limit, DNS packets were dropped, meaning services were unable to resolve network addresses which resulted in application failures. Services retried their DNS queries upon receiving a SERVFAIL response or query timeout, which created even more connections - compounding the problem.\n\nDuring the incident, Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure in the AWS us-east-1 region was unable to service up to 90% of DNS resolution requests.\n\nWe were not aware of how close our infrastructure was to the security group connection tracking limit because utilization of this allowance is not currently observable.\n\nTroubleshooting took an extended period of time because EC2 network allowance packet drops \\(as a result of encountering this limit\\) [were not actively monitored](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-network-performance-ena.html) by Atlassian.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nAtlassian acknowledges that outages like this one impact the productivity and business of our customers. Since this incident:\n\n* We have deployed an immediate change to prevent traffic through Atlassian’s EC2-based DNS infrastructure from [consuming the security group connection allowance limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#untracked-connections). As a result of this change, this incident cannot reoccur.\n* We are investigating ways to improve our visibility into the utilization of AWS network allowance limits and will [monitor packet drops](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-network-performance-ena.html) due to them. \n* We are continuing our migration of internal services away from the EC2-based DNS infrastructure involved in this incident to a new, distributed architecture that is not subject to these network limits.\n\nAgain, we apologize to those customers whose services were impacted during this incident.\n\nThank you,  \nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn NOV 7, 2022 between 8:10 AM and 7:26 PM UTC, Atlassian customers using Confluence experienced degraded performance. The event was triggered by database migrations which impacted customers in a single database instance in the European region. The incident was detected within 28 minutes by Atlassian’s internal automated monitoring system system and mitigated by scaling the database instance size which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 11 hours and 16 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nSome customer database instances were over provisioned and experienced intermittent slow performance, request timeouts, and complete downtime.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by database migrations performed for maintenance operation. The migration resulted in over provisioning and caused database CPU to spike to 100%. The CPU spike resulted in degraded performance for Confluence.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified earlier because modeling customer usage is nuanced and even slight error in modeling will result in over provisioning or under provisioning.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Adding more metrics used in customer usage modeling.\n* Improving automated tenant rebalancing to avoid over provisioning or under provisioning.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The incident was automatically detected at 05.14 by one of Atlassian’s automated monitoring systems. The main disruption was resolved within 16 minutes with the full recovery taking additional 74 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nBetween July 19, 2022, 05:40 UTC and July 19, 2022, 07:10 UTC Jira, Confluence and OpsGenie users saw some web pages fail to load. During the 16 minute period from 06:40 UTC to 6:56 UTC, customers were unable to access Jira Confluence and OpsGenie web UI because the Atlassian Proxy \\(the ingress point for service requests\\) was unable to service most requests.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an AWS initiated change that impacted Elastic Block Store \\(EBS\\) volume performance to such an extent that new instance creation and therefore auto scaling, was blocked.  As a result, the products above, as well as essential internal Atlassian services could not auto scale to the increasing incoming service requests as the EU region came online. Once the AWS change had been rolled back, most Atlassian services recovered. Some internal services required manual scaling as a result of unhealthy nodes preventing scaling initiation, which prolonged complete recovery.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity and we apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident. We see two main avenues to increase our resiliency during an incident where AWS auto scaling is blocked:\n\n* Implement step scaling: Simple scaling in most cases works well. In this case due to nodes becoming unhealthy, simple scaling stops responding to scaling alarms and therefore the service can become “stuck” and will not recover once scaling is possible again. We are exploring the use of step scaling, as this will allow scaling even in the case of instances becoming unhealthy.\n* Implement improved alarming to identify “stuck” scaling to increase the TTR when scaling is available again.\n\nWe are taking these immediate steps to improve the platform’s resiliency.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian",

While for Bitbucket Pipelines there was an increase in build failures, Jira, Confluence, and Forge experienced performance and functionality degradation. The event was triggered by our internal Artifact Repository Manager becoming unavailable during a scheduled multi-availability zone disaster recovery test. Customers across all regions were affected. The incident was detected within two minutes by monitoring and mitigated by restarting the Artifact Repository service, which recovered the affected products. The total time to resolution was about three hours.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between June 22, 2022, 01:08 AM UTC, and June 22, 2022, 05:58 AM UTC on Bitbucket Pipelines, Confluence Cloud, Forge, and Jira Cloud family of products \\(Jira Software, Jira Service Management, Jira Work Management\\). The outage of the internal Artifact Repository Manager caused scalability problems in the aforementioned products and an inability to build or deploy new versions of our services. That meant the degradation of performance and functionality for most of these products.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an outage of the internal Artifact Repository Manager during the planned multi-availability zone disaster recovery test. As a result, the products listed above could not access docker images and other necessary artifacts to scale up, which caused partial degradation of services or complete unavailability of services for some customers. The restart of the internal Artifact Repository Manager caused downtime to the service but led to successful recovery.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages may impact your productivity. After the immediate impact of this outage was resolved, the incident response team completed a technical analysis of the root cause and contributing factors. The team has conducted a post-incident review to determine how we can avoid the impact of this kind of outage in the future.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* We raised a critical issue with the vendor who provides us with software for Artifact Management to optimise the resilience of the application caused by availability zone failures.\n* We are working on improving our disaster recovery plan to be able to mitigate such incidents faster.\n* We are reviewing our test strategies to be able to catch similar issues in the early stages.\n\nTo minimize the impact of such incidents on our customers, we will implement additional preventative measures such as:\n\n* Development of a redundant caching mechanism for our platform system to improve the scalability and reliability of our products.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn May 03, 2022, between 13:21 and 14:12 UTC, a majority of AMER and EMEA customers using Jira Software, Jira Service Management, or Confluence Cloud as well as all customers of Bitbucket Cloud were unable to search for users and teams, mention users and teams, assign issues and tickets, and perform some JQL queries. The incident was triggered by a throughput issue after a routine upgrade of a primary database cluster in our eu-west region followed by a failure of multiple levels of redundancy. Our us-east and eu-west regions were affected.\n\nThe incident was detected within one minute by our monitoring systems and our on-call engineer responded approximately four minutes after impact began. The team was able to mitigate this issue by shedding some of the load on our us-east region by reversing the failover for team search. Our SLOs returned to normal after approximately 51 minutes. Over the following 48 hours, our engineers monitored the situation and worked to restore the redundant systems to normal operation.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between May 03, 2022, 13:21 UTC and May 03, 2022, 14:12 UTC. The incident caused service disruption to AMER and EMEA customers using Jira Software, Jira Service Management, or Confluence Cloud as well as all customers of Bitbucket Cloud. Specifically, the features below were impacted during this time:\n\nJira Software & Jira Service Management\n\n* Assigning issues and tickets to users\n* Mentioning users or teams\n* Some JQL queries involving user details\n* Searching for users\n* Searching for teams\n\nConfluence Cloud\n\n* Mentioning users or teams\n* Searching for users\n* Searching for teams\n\nBitbucket Cloud\n\n* Mentioning users or teams\n* Searching for users\n* Searching for teams\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe user search service, a central service responsible for storing and returning user search results from our cloud products, has two redundant database clusters provisioned in five globally distributed regions. Each database cluster is intended to be large enough to be able to support all search traffic in case of a database failure or database maintenance. Over the last couple of weeks, we began to see latency for search responses increase in our eu-west region, which generally indicates under-scaled clusters. \n\nThe team began the process of increasing the scale of our clusters in our eu-west region. We began work on May 02, 2022 at 19:44 UTC to scale up our primary database cluster and updated our configuration so all search traffic in our eu-west region was served from our redundant database cluster. The process started when our eu-west traffic was off-peak and gave us a 10 hour window to minimize risk.\n\nThis routine upgrade was expected to provide a 20% increase in throughput. But for an unknown reason currently under investigation by Amazon Web Services, we observed reduced throughput in that database cluster by at least 75%. This left our eu-west region without a primary database cluster and a redundant database cluster not yet scaled to handle peak traffic. The team spent the next 10 hours, with support from AWS, attempting to fix the degraded database cluster before peak traffic.\n\nUnfortunately, the team was unable to recover the performance of our primary database cluster and the redundant database cluster was unable to handle peak load in our eu-west region. The team immediately triggered a failover of all eu-west traffic to our us-east region as soon as search latencies exceeded SLOs. Our us-east region's traffic was off-peak and the us-east database clusters are significantly larger than database clusters in other regions. These larger database clusters are designed to give us the ability to safely handle region failovers. The failover occurred on May 03, 2022 at 08:37 UTC. Approximately 5 hours later, on May 03, 2022 at 13:25 UTC, the on-call engineer was paged due to multiple node failures in our us-east region.\n\nIn rare situations, the database cluster can have a node failure due to a variety of causes. The database cluster can self-heal by relocating its data onto new nodes. The user search team has built a mechanism to force all traffic to the redundant cluster in that region immediately after a node failure is detected. This mechanism allows the user search service to meet its latency and reliability SLOs in that region and reduces the load on the unhealthy database cluster to expedite its recovery.\n\nUnfortunately, this put four times the normal amount of traffic on our redundant database cluster in our us-east region. This amount of load is well outside of our current design specifications and the database cluster could not keep up with this intense load. User search requests began to timeout and the products that make requests to this core user search service were unable to return search results to our customers. The team was able to mitigate this issue by shedding some of the load on our us-east region by reversing the failover for only team search, a low-touch, but resource-intense query. This was enough to stabilize the us-east cluster enough to handle peak traffic. Our SLOs returned to normal after approximately 51 minutes. Over the following 48 hours, our engineers monitored the situation and worked to restore the redundant systems to normal operation.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWhile we have a number of redundancies in place, we have multiple things we can do to prevent cascading failures of multiple redundant systems in the future. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* A temporary scale up of all database clusters to a level above design spec in all regions hosting the user search service. This will allow the service to handle multiple region failovers gracefully.\n* Set up a periodic review of our database cluster performance with the goal of deciding if the team should temporarily or permanently scale up clusters to keep up with demand.\n* We are reprioritizing our efforts towards the rollout of an upcoming architecture change designed to significantly improve the performance and resiliency of the service.\n* The user search service team will update their runbooks on how to better respond to multi-region failures.\n* Continue working with AWS to fully understand the root cause behind the failed database cluster upgrade.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

We are beginning to shift towards a more automated process to restore sites. That said, there are still a number of steps required before we hand a site to customers for review and acceptance.\nWe are restoring affected customers identified by a mix of multiple variables including site size, complexity, edition, tenure, and several other factors in groups of up to 60 at a time. The full restoration process involves our engineering teams, our customer support teams, and our customer, and has three steps:\n  1. Technical restoration involving meta-data recovery, data restores across a number of services, and ensuring the data across the different systems is working correctly for product and ecosystem apps\n  2. Verification of site functionality to ensure the technical restoration has worked as expected\n  3. Lastly, working directly with the affected customer to enable them to verify their data and functionality before enabling for their users\nWe have also contacted all customers who are *up next* for step 3 in the site restoration process described above. These customers are aware that they are next in queue through their support ticket and/or via a support engineer.\nWe have proactively reached out to technical contacts and system admins at all impacted customers, and opened support tickets for each of them. However, we learned that some customers have not yet heard from us or engaged with our support team.

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nBetween March 18th, 2022 12:00AM and March 21st, 2022 9:29AM UTC, some Atlassian customers may have experienced varying levels of degradation across our different services and products, including Atlassian partner apps. The full list of impacted products is listed below in the `impact` section. This event was triggered as a result of a fault in Atlassian’s underlying feature flagging tool. The incident was detected through internal monitoring and support requests from customers and partners. The issue in the underlying service has been resolved, returning impacted Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was 3 Days 9 Hours 29 Minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between March 18th, 2022 12:00AM and March 21st, 2022 9:29AM UTC. The impacted products were:\n\n**Jira**\n\n* During this incident Jira partners would have had a reduction to the number of web hooks they could create\n\n**Confluence** \\(only impacted between March 18th, 2022 12:00AM and March 21st 2022 04:20am UTC\\)\n\n* During this incident Confluence customers and consumers of their API would have been unable to:\n\n    * Search for user name via the user profile macro\n    * Create templates in the new editor\n    * Correctly consume the user search API\n    * View the people menu\n    \n* During this incident customers would have received emailed from `bounce@spemail-us.atlassian.net` instead of `confluence@mail-eu.atlassian.net`\n\n**Atlassian Account**\n\n* During this incident customers would have been unable to login/consent with OpenID or use OpenID to link their Atlassian Account\n\n**Customer Support**\n\n* During this incident customers would have been unable to perform some actions on their tickets including\n\n    * Escalating their issue on `https://getsupport.atlassian.com/`\n    * Using the bug template on `https://jira.atlassian.com/`\n    \n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an incident in Atlassian’s underlying feature flag tooling which exposed some errors in Atlassian’s consumption of feature flags. This resulted in some feature flags no longer evaluating as expected, resulting in Atlassian customers losing access to features or being shown older versions of features.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nAtlassian acknowledges that outages impact your productivity and business. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified due to minimal monitoring for the specific fault which occurred in our underlying feature flag tooling.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident in the future:\n\n* Improvements to our consumption of feature flags in the impacted products and services to provide sensible fallbacks in the event this occurs again\n* Adding additional monitoring and alerting around our underlying feature flag tooling and its integration points within our products and services reduce our time to detection in the event this occurs again\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
