          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn September 22, 2025, between 04:38 and 04:48 UTC, Atlassian customers experienced connection errors preventing access to their [atlassian.net](http://atlassian.net/) sites. Some customers observed intermittent errors as services gradually recovered until 06:17 UTC.\n\nThe event was triggered by a faulty configuration change to our Content Delivery Network \\(CDN\\). The change included an invalid hostname which prevented customers from successfully connecting to [atlassian.net](http://atlassian.net/) domains.\n\nThe incident was detected within 1 minute by our monitoring systems and mitigated by rolling back the change, which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The acute impact was resolved in 10 minutes and all lingering errors resolved in 1 hour 38 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe acute impact occurred on September 22, 2025, between 04:38 UTC and 04:48 UTC to Confluence, Compass and Jira, including Jira Service Management. The incident caused service disruption to customers when they attempted to load those products in their browser or interact with APIs. Between 04:48 UTC and 06:17 UTC some customers continued to observe intermittent errors as services gradually recovered.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a change to the hostname configuration of our Content Delivery Network \\(CDN\\). As a result, the products mentioned could not receive connections, and the users received TLS handshake errors, followed by HTTP 503 and 403 errors.\n\nMore specifically a new CDN configuration contained a resource name which conflicted with the existing customer-serving CDN resource, and was able to be deployed, overwriting it. The root cause of the incident was the failure in the detection of the bug by our pre-deployment validations and tests.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that you rely on our products for your daily operations and productivity, and we sincerely apologize for any impact this disruption has had on you, your team or your organisation.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to help avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Improved pre-deployment change controls and testing.\n* Improved validation of target configurations before deployment to ensure customer-serving CDN resources cannot their hostnames changed.\n* Sharding of our CDN configuration to enable progressive changes.\n\nWe sincerely appreciate your understanding and patience as we improve our processes to provide a better customer experience.\n\nThank you,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The event was triggered by a temporarily spiked error on Confluence backend services due to a capacity issue. Our alerts detected the incident within 1 minute and the impact was mitigated by scaling up the backend service that was under load. This restored the Atlassian services to a fully operational state. The total time to resolution was approximately 26 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe impact was on Apr 15, 2025, between 14:29 and 14:55 UTC, to customers using Confluence Cloud. The incident caused service disruption to some EU central region customers, resulting in reduced functionality and limited access when loading Confluence pages, space overviews, and the home page.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident's root cause stemmed from one of Confluence's non-critical backend services not being fully scaled to accommodate an unusual spike in traffic. Although failures from this backend service shouldn't affect page views critically, it was treated as a severe failure, impacting the Confluence core experience in this incident.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTION PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe fully understand that outages impact your productivity. We continuously evaluate and validate the capacity of our backend services that are critical to the Confluence user experience. However, the impact of this non-critical backend service on the Confluence page view functionality was not identified beforehand.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions designed to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Reviewing the peak capacity allocated for critical backend services and ensuring that adequate capacity is reserved to encounter traffic spikes.\n* Introducing fallback mechanisms for failures from non-critical backend services to improve Confluence service resiliency.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted by this incident. We are taking steps designed to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The incident was triggered by the deployment of a monitoring library upgrade, which slowed the execution of all rules. This reduced the throughput of rule processing which resulted in rules being backed up and delayed. The change manifested in poor rule performance only during periods of high traffic. This incident occurred over two time windows. For the first incident window, backed-up rule executions began to reduce 4 hours 15 minutes after the first alert, and all rules had caught up 7 hours after the first alert. For the second incident window, backed-up rule executions began to reduce 1 hour, 50 minutes after the first alert, and all rules had caught up 10 hours after the first alert.\n\nThe root cause of both incidents was identified and a change to address it was deployed by 10am UTC on March 19, 2025.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe customer’s rules were delayed on average by 1.5 hours and up to 12 hours during both incident windows. A very small number of rules encountered the following error: “_The rule actor doesn't have permission to view the event that triggered this rule_.” This error occurred because of rate limiting implemented by an internal Atlassian service due to increased throughput resulting from our mitigation efforts. These rules failed to complete successfully. All other rules eventually ran successfully.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a change introduced to an Atlassian monitoring library, which significantly degraded the Automation rule engine's performance. The performance degradation prevented Automation's system from keeping pace with processing throughput, causing a back-up of executions and subsequent customer rule delays.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue didn’t manifest itself until our systems were at peak load.\n\nThe change to the Atlassian monitoring library that was the root cause of the incident has been fixed.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions that are designed to avoid a repeat of this type of incident:\n\n* Deploying the fixed monitoring library after thorough testing\n* Implementing additional monitoring and alerting to the area of our system affected with performance degradation\n* Introducing additional pre-deployment testing designed to identify performance degradations before they impact customers\n* Increasing rate limits of certain downstream Atlassian systems to reduce the likelihood of the rule failures that occurred in this incident\n* Increasing the processing capacity of parts of our system to reduce the impact of backed up rule executions\n\nWe apologize to customers whose automation rules were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps designed to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

This disruption was due to our Content Delivery Network \\(CDN\\) not having sufficient capacity in Brazil under a certain network configuration.\n\nChanges in the lead-up to the incident included enabling CDN for Jira and Confluence in Brazil between January 20th and February 6th to improve performance and security.\n\nJira and Confluence experience success rate monitoring detected the incident within 50 minutes. The incident was mitigated by temporarily disabling CDN in Brazil, which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was two hours and 25 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on February 10, 2025, between 16:10 and 18:35 UTC to Jira and Confluence Cloud_._ The incident caused service disruption to Brazilian customers when they attempted to access or use any feature of those products. Customers observed a generic error page or “HTTP 500” error presented by our CDN provider for up to a third of all requests at peak.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nOur CDN is configured to present Jira and Confluence Cloud from static IP ranges dedicated to Atlassian.\n\nThis configuration limited the number of edge locations servicing customer requests, causing a high concentration of connections in the Brazilian region on one edge location in particular.\n\nWhen daily traffic volumes in Brazil peaked on February 10, connections through the edge location to our servers encountered a capacity limit and were rejected with a HTTP 500 error.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTION PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe understand that outages impact your productivity. We apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. Along with our CDN provider, we have already taken the following actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Our CDN provider has completed the rollout of the static, dedicated IP feature to all their edge locations and enabled Jira and Confluence Cloud to be served from all of them, thus moving to the intended configuration that will provide full network capacity.\n* We are working with our CDN provider to perform more rigorous checks of capacity and configuration for Jira and Confluence Cloud.\n* Our CDN provider increased the server connection limit for Jira and Confluence Cloud in all locations, further increasing capacity.\n* Based on the observed failure patterns, we have created additional monitoring and alerting configurations, so we will be alerted immediately if the issue reoccurs.\n\nAdditionally, we are prioritizing actions to improve the detection of failures that affect a specific region.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### Summary\n\nOn January 28, 2025, between 13:35 and 15:10 UTC, Atlassian customers using Confluence Cloud experienced difficulties viewing, editing and creating pages. This disruption was caused by a faulty version of a third-party app which caused a grey overlay that obscured fully loaded Confluence pages, affecting customers who had the app installed.\n\nCustomers reported the issue, and the Atlassian team began their investigation within 10 minutes after receiving the support tickets.\n\n**Timeline of events**\n\n* The app vendor released version \\(1.3.39-AC\\) of the app on January 28, 2025, 13:35 UTC.\n* Atlassian team got notified of the incident on January 28, 2025, 14:02 UTC, tried to reproduce the issue and involved the on-call teams.\n* The app vendor released version \\(1.3.41-AC\\) of the app on January 28, 2025 14:35 UTC .\n* Atlassian team notified customers to update the app to the latest version \\(1.3.41-AC\\) through our Statuspage on January 28, 2025, 15:06 UTC.\n* The app vendor released a hot-fix for the existing faulty version \\(1.3.39-AC\\) of the app on January 28, 2025, 15:10 UTC. This helped mitigate the incident in one hour and 35 minutes.\n\nFurthermore, the Atlassian team initiated a mandatory update to the latest version \\(1.3.41-AC\\) for all customers of the app on January 28, 2025, 16:37 UTC.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between January 28, 2025, 13: 35 UTC and 15:10 PM UTC on Confluence Cloud. The incident caused service disruption to customers having the third-party app installed, where they were unable to view, edit, or create pages on Confluence Cloud.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue arose from a problematic version release of a third-party app.\n\n**How it started?**\n\nThe app vendor uploaded a new version of their app \\(1.3.39-AC\\) to the marketplace, making it available for automatic updates. Customer sites check for new minor app versions and update automatically within a rolling 24-hour period. However, an issue arose when the vendor deployed new frontend code that relied on a specific component available only in the latest app version. This created a dependency mismatch, leading to an error.\n\nThe app’s frontend code is delivered through the vendor's CDN, and during testing, no issues were detected. However, when the updated JavaScript code was deployed to the CDN, it assumed the presence of the new component. Unfortunately, not all customers were updated to the latest app version because of our progressive updates, resulting in some using older app descriptors that lacked the required component.\n\nThis mismatch triggered Confluence to display a full-screen dialog on every page load. The Confluence frontend rendered the dialog, which included an iframe to load the app’s code. Since the app had not been updated on some customer sites, the required component’s data could not be loaded, causing a grey overlay with error message to appear on the users’ screens.\n\nThe Confluence frontend provided functionality to close the dialog using the escape key. However, because the app failed to load the necessary data, the dialog displayed a generic error message overlaid with a grey opaque screen. Customers were unaware of the escape key workaround, leaving them unable to dismiss the dialog easily.\n\n**How was it mitigated?**\n\n* The app vendor deployed a new version \\(1.3.41-AC\\) of the descriptor.\n* Atlassian team notified customers to update to the \\(1.3.41-AC\\) on StatusPage\n* The app vendor released a hotfix for \\(1.3.39-AC\\) which removed the reference to the new component.\n\nThe issue was resolved in one hour and 35 minutes.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the third-party app created an overlay on our loaded pages and that was not picked up by our monitoring systems.\n\nWe are working to improve the monitoring and detection of such app triggered failures. To prevent the recurrence of this type of incident, and detect such incidents faster, we are prioritizing the following improvement actions:\n\n* We are developing a solution in our UX components to be resilient to app errors.\n* We are also developing a solution where we can have clear messaging to exit from overlays that are taking the whole screen.\n* We are working on improving our monitoring for this specific scenario.\n\nWe are collaborating with app vendors to share guidance on dependency component versioning. Therefore, the app vendors need to make changes in a more backward compatible manner.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
