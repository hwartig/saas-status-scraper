          "body": "### Summary\n\nOn January 28, 2025, between 13:35 and 15:10 UTC, Atlassian customers using Confluence Cloud experienced difficulties viewing, editing and creating pages. This disruption was caused by a faulty version of a third-party app which caused a grey overlay that obscured fully loaded Confluence pages, affecting customers who had the app installed.\n\nCustomers reported the issue, and the Atlassian team began their investigation within 10 minutes after receiving the support tickets.\n\n**Timeline of events**\n\n* The app vendor released version \\(1.3.39-AC\\) of the app on January 28, 2025, 13:35 UTC.\n* Atlassian team got notified of the incident on January 28, 2025, 14:02 UTC, tried to reproduce the issue and involved the on-call teams.\n* The app vendor released version \\(1.3.41-AC\\) of the app on January 28, 2025 14:35 UTC .\n* Atlassian team notified customers to update the app to the latest version \\(1.3.41-AC\\) through our Statuspage on January 28, 2025, 15:06 UTC.\n* The app vendor released a hot-fix for the existing faulty version \\(1.3.39-AC\\) of the app on January 28, 2025, 15:10 UTC. This helped mitigate the incident in one hour and 35 minutes.\n\nFurthermore, the Atlassian team initiated a mandatory update to the latest version \\(1.3.41-AC\\) for all customers of the app on January 28, 2025, 16:37 UTC.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between January 28, 2025, 13: 35 UTC and 15:10 PM UTC on Confluence Cloud. The incident caused service disruption to customers having the third-party app installed, where they were unable to view, edit, or create pages on Confluence Cloud.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue arose from a problematic version release of a third-party app.\n\n**How it started?**\n\nThe app vendor uploaded a new version of their app \\(1.3.39-AC\\) to the marketplace, making it available for automatic updates. Customer sites check for new minor app versions and update automatically within a rolling 24-hour period. However, an issue arose when the vendor deployed new frontend code that relied on a specific component available only in the latest app version. This created a dependency mismatch, leading to an error.\n\nThe app’s frontend code is delivered through the vendor's CDN, and during testing, no issues were detected. However, when the updated JavaScript code was deployed to the CDN, it assumed the presence of the new component. Unfortunately, not all customers were updated to the latest app version because of our progressive updates, resulting in some using older app descriptors that lacked the required component.\n\nThis mismatch triggered Confluence to display a full-screen dialog on every page load. The Confluence frontend rendered the dialog, which included an iframe to load the app’s code. Since the app had not been updated on some customer sites, the required component’s data could not be loaded, causing a grey overlay with error message to appear on the users’ screens.\n\nThe Confluence frontend provided functionality to close the dialog using the escape key. However, because the app failed to load the necessary data, the dialog displayed a generic error message overlaid with a grey opaque screen. Customers were unaware of the escape key workaround, leaving them unable to dismiss the dialog easily.\n\n**How was it mitigated?**\n\n* The app vendor deployed a new version \\(1.3.41-AC\\) of the descriptor.\n* Atlassian team notified customers to update to the \\(1.3.41-AC\\) on StatusPage\n* The app vendor released a hotfix for \\(1.3.39-AC\\) which removed the reference to the new component.\n\nThe issue was resolved in one hour and 35 minutes.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the third-party app created an overlay on our loaded pages and that was not picked up by our monitoring systems.\n\nWe are working to improve the monitoring and detection of such app triggered failures. To prevent the recurrence of this type of incident, and detect such incidents faster, we are prioritizing the following improvement actions:\n\n* We are developing a solution in our UX components to be resilient to app errors.\n* We are also developing a solution where we can have clear messaging to exit from overlays that are taking the whole screen.\n* We are working on improving our monitoring for this specific scenario.\n\nWe are collaborating with app vendors to share guidance on dependency component versioning. Therefore, the app vendors need to make changes in a more backward compatible manner.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

During the deployment, the team encountered an issue that necessitated a manual rollback. The rollback reverted the region to use the previous nodes, which weren’t pre-scaled to handle existing traffic at the time. Consequently, this caused stress on the service. In response, the team immediately scaled up the nodes in the region. By 9:24 PM UTC, the service was fully restored, resulting in an outage that lasted for 13 minutes.\n\nAtlassian is conducting an internal post-incident review and will take the required actions to prevent this kind of incident from happening again.\n\nWe sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.",

This was primarily due to connectivity issues with an external service provider, which impacted our ability to perform certain operations integral to our services. The incident was promptly identified through our monitoring systems, and our teams initiated response protocols to address the issue. The disruption resulted in increased error rates across Jira and Confluence products, temporarily affecting the experience for some of our users.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nOn August 29, 2024, between 8:32 AM and 11:35 AM UTC, there was an impact on Confluence and Jira cloud affecting customers in multiple regions. The total time to resolution was three hours and three minutes.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an outage on our external security token provider. Services which requested security tokens experienced timeouts leading to outages for our cloud products.\n\nOur automated monitoring system detected the incident within one minute and we confirmed the external service outage with the external provider. The provider resolved the outage at 10:02 AM UTC, and full system recovery for Atlassian was completed by 11:35 AM UTC.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are committed to reducing the risk of similar incidents in the future. To achieve this, we will enhance our system's ability to handle external service disruptions and improve our incident response strategies. Specifically, we will reduce our reliance on single points of failure by setting up fallback region support for the critical security service provider. Additionally, we will implement measures to minimize the recovery time of the Atlassian services once the external security provider has recovered.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Other affected features that faced intermittent failures are inviting teammates to Jira/Confluence, Jira Service Management helpseeker sign-up using email domain, and creating requests in the Jira portal.\n\n‌\n\nThe event was triggered by a faulty database configuration change, which caused approximately 25% of new login attempts to fail. The Automated Monitoring system detected the incident within five minutes and mitigated it by reverting the database configuration, which put Atlassian systems into a known-good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour and 51 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on August 22 2024, between 17:04 and 18:55 UTC on Jira, Jira Service Management, and Confluence products. The Incident caused service disruption to customers across all regions where the new logins experienced intermittent failures.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a faulty database auto-scaling configuration change. As a result, 25% of the new Atlassian login attempts received HTTP 5xx errors.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the change was related to the system's traffic load. The change reduced the database's autoscaling capacity, which was sufficient for low load conditions, but as traffic increased, the capacity was not enough. The automated testing didn’t load the system enough to detect the issue.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Streamline the login flow such that inviting teammates or helpseeker sign-ups etc are not part of the main workflow;\n* Improve the deployment pipelines such that changes to resources like database can be deployed and tested independent of the code for faster delivery.\n\nFurthermore, we deploy our changes progressively to avoid broad impact. This works well for changes in code, but in this case, the change was to a global resource like database configuration where it gets deployed universally. To minimize the impact of changes to our environments, we will implement additional preventative measures such as:\n\n* Update the testing guidelines so that any database/infrastructure change needs to complete more thorough performance and reliability testing;\n* Fix the dashboards for the traffic monitoring such that they show traffic for correct tables and indices.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The event was triggered by temporarily reduced capacity following a rollback deployment, with insufficient nodes to handle the load. Our alerts detected the incident within two minutes and mitigated it by rolling forward the release and manually adding more nodes, which put Atlassian systems into a known-good state. The total time to resolution was about 64 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on June 04, 2024, between 07:28 and 08:32 UTC, to customers using Confluence Cloud. The Incident caused service disruption to some EU Central region customers, resulting in reduced functionality, slower response times, and limited access when loading Confluence pages, space overview pages, and the home page.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nWhen we deploy and release our changes to all the different regions, we execute a progressive rollout strategy. This helps us catch any issues proactively. If an issue is found during deployment, the deployment is paused and an automated rollback to the previous release is triggered. In this case, there was a timeout from our configuration to our cloud provider for one region, which forced an automated rollback to the previous release in all the regions. As that rollback happened in the EU Central region, there needed to be more compute nodes to handle the high traffic. Other regions rolled back successfully with no customer impact.\n\nThus the root cause of the incident was the failure to scale our nodes to the optimal capacity caused by an automated rollback of a release.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have several testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because it was an issue in our deployment pipeline that was not picked up by our regular automated continuous deployment suites and manual test scripts.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Introduce more aggressive scaling of our nodes to handle incoming traffic if we rollback to an older release\n* Address gaps in deployment and testing processes, add more post-deployment validations to handle these cases\n* Have a fallback to an alternative source when we cannot render the experiences due to these failures\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted by this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### Summary\n\nOn June 3rd, between 09:43pm and 10:58 pm UTC, Atlassian customers using multiple product\\(s\\) were unable to access their services. The event was triggered by a change to the infrastructure API Gateway, which is responsible for routing the traffic to the correct application backends.\n\nThe incident was detected by the automated monitoring system within five minutes and mitigated by correcting a faulty release feature flag, which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The first communications were published on the Statuspage at 11:11pm UTC. The total time to resolution was about 75 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between 09:43pm and 10:17pm UTC, with the system initially in a degraded state, followed by a total outage between 10:17pm and 10:58pm UTC. \n\n_The Incident caused service disruption to customers in all regions and affected the following products:_\n\n* Jira Software\n* Jira Service Management\n* Jira Work Management\n* Jira Product Discovery\n* Jira Align\n* Confluence\n* Trello\n* Bitbucket\n* Opsgenie\n* Compass\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nA policy used in the infrastructure API gateway was being updated in production via a feature flag. The combination of an erroneous value entered in a feature flag, and a bug in the code resulted in the API Gateway not processing any traffic.\n\nThis created a total outage, where all users started receiving 5XX errors for most Atlassian products.\n\nOnce the problem was identified and the feature flag updated to the correct values, all services started seeing recovery immediately.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have several testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because the change did not go through our regular release process and instead was incorrectly applied through a feature flag.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Prevent high-risk feature flags from being used in production\n* Improve the policy changes testing\n* Enforcing longer soak time for policy changes\n* Any feature flags should go through progressive rollouts to minimize broad impact\n* Review the infrastructure feature flags to ensure they all have appropriate defaults\n* Improve our processes and internal tooling to provide faster communications to our customers\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were affected by this incident and are taking immediate steps to address the above gaps.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
