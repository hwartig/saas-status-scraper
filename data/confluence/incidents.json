          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn JUN 14, 2023, between 18:55 and 19:50 UTC, Atlassian customers using Confluence may not have been able to access their Confluence site. The event was triggered by a name change made to an infrastructural service which Confluence uses for monitoring, which impacted customers in US regions \\(prod-west2 and prod-east\\). The incident was detected within 10 minutes by monitoring and mitigated by scaling up the Confluence API gateway, as well as reverting the renaming of the infrastructural service. This put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 55 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nBetween June 14, 2023 18:55 and June 14, 2023 19:50 UTC, Confluence customers in the US East and West regions may have not been able to access their Confluence sites. This impact did not extend to all Confluence sites or users on a given site, as the nature of the issue meant that some users requests to their site may have succeeded, while others failed.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThis incident was caused by a name change to an infrastructural service that Confluence uses for monitoring purposes. This service is normally invoked by Confluence's gateway on every web request which is received. However when the infrastructural service’s name was updated, a new failure mode was induced in the Confluence gateway service, which in turn began a memory leak. Under high load, Confluence’s gateway hosts experienced an out of memory condition which caused the service degradation encountered during this incident.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because:\n\n* There were naming convention challenges and internal team miscommunication during the rollout of the name change to the infrastructural service.\n* The infrastructural service which was renamed does not directly provide customer functionality, and is only used internally by engineers for monitoring. As such, while tests do exist for this code, they do not check for name changes such as what occurred in this outage.\n* The fault wasn’t detected in our staging environment because when the load was low, the memory leak was very slow, and when the load was higher, active load testing masked node failures.\n* The Confluence gateway code which invokes the infrastructural service was not resilient to a potential naming change, and was not using environmental variables.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* The Confluence gateway service will adopt the recommended practice to use environmental variables when invoking infrastructural services.\n* The Confluence gateway service will make the relevant code more robust to ensure the system can bypass this non-critical path infrastructure service if it is not available generally.\n* We will implement checks when the Confluence gateway service is deployed to fail at deploy time if a key dependency cannot be invoked \\(by a specific name or otherwise\\).\n* Our infrastructure team will perform additional verification checks when decommissioning production infrastructure to ensure it isn't still being actively used by critical workloads.\n\nFurthermore, to minimize the impact of breaking changes to our environments, we will implement additional detection measures such as:\n\n* We will improve monitoring and alerts in our staging environment for Confluence's gateway service. While we do have alerts in production which fired properly, we will enable them for staging and reduce lag time between the event firing and alerts being generated in staging.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Some other AWS services also experienced increased error rates and latencies as a result of degraded Lambda functions invocations.  This incident was automatically detected by multiple monitoring systems within 6 minutes, paging on-call teams. Recovery of the affected AWS Lambda service began after 116 minutes at June 13th 8:45 PM UTC.  Full recovery of all AWS services occurred at 10:37 PM UTC June 13th after the backlog of asynchronous Lambda events had been processed. Some Jira tenants with large event backlogs experienced delays in running schedule-based rule reruns. Full recovery of all Atlassian Cloud services was notified at June 14, 2023, 02:20 AM UTC.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between June 13, 2023, 06:49 PM UTC and June 14, 2023, 02:20 AM UTC.  Product-specific impacts are listed below.\n\n* Jira Software, Jira Service Management,  Jira Work Management - Automation rules were not executed for 2 hours between Jun 13, 06:49 PM UTC and Jun 13, 08:45 PM UTC.  Jira automation events generated during this period were unable to be rerun.  When AWS Lambda recovered delays were still experienced in our schedule-based and event-based rules for some larger tenants due to a large backlog of events. Full recovery was at June 14, 2023, 02:20 AM UTC.\n* Confluence - Automation rules were not executed for 2 hours between Jun 13, 06:49 PM UTC and Jun 13, 08:45 PM UTC.  On AWS service restoration Confluence automation recovered and Confluence automation events generated during this period were rerun and processed.  Full recovery was at June 14, 2023, 12:41 AM UTC.\n* Jira Product Discovery - Automation rules were not executed for 2 hours between Jun 13, 06:49 PM UTC and Jun 13, 08:45 PM UTC. Jira automation events generated during this period were unable to be rerun.  Sending feedback/filing a support ticket from the application did not work. \n* Trello -  Email to board delays, card covers image upload failures, attachment preview generation failures, board background upload failures, custom sticker images upload failures, custom emoji upload failures. Trello automation was unaffected. Full recovery was at June 13, 2023, 10:08 PM UTC.\n\nThe service disruption lasted for 7 hours and 1 minutes between June 13, 2023, 06:49 PM UTC and June 14, 2023, 02:20 AM UTC and caused service disruption to customers with services hosted in the US-EAST-1 region.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nAtlassian uses Amazon Web Services \\(AWS\\) as a cloud service provider. The root cause was an issue with a subsystem responsible for capacity management for AWS Lambda in US-EAST-1 Region, which also impacted 104 AWS services.  This impacted Automation rules as the service is hosted exclusively in this region.\n\nThere were no relevant Atlassian-driven events in the lead-up that have been identified to cause or contribute to this incident.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Increase reliability of message delivery and recoverability from Jira to Automation platform to improve recovery times. \n* Create a plan for multi-region impact mitigation for Automation.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The incident was detected within three minutes by automated monitoring and mitigated by a rollback of the change which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour and 32 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe impact across products was:\n\n* Bitbucket - Bitbucket Pipelines self-hosted builds were failing, access to Git LFS failed and cloud-hosted builds were delayed.\n* Confluence, Jira Align, Jira Service Management, Jira Software, Jira Work Management, Jira Product Discovery, and Atlas - media capabilities \\(images, videos, documents, audio\\) were affected and it was not possible to upload, download or view existing media attachments or files.\n\nThe service disruption lasted for one hour and 32 minutes between May 15, 2023, 02:36 and May 15, 2023, 04:08 UTC and caused service disruption to customers with services hosted in the us-west-1 region.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an attempted migration of a service to a new network segment. As part of this migration, a DNS record pointing to the old network segment was not updated, which resulted in failure when the old network stack was removed. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified as moving services across network segments is not a regular activity and is difficult to accurately replicate in a test environment. To mitigate against these types of issues, we made this change using blue/green deployment practices but failed to run adequate verification steps before decommissioning the old stack.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Reviewing our systems that decommission service stacks and implementing checks that customer traffic is no longer being served prior to decommissioning the stacks; and\n* As part of our service network migration process, we are adding steps to identify when there are associated DNS records that require attention.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn January 20, 2023, between 08:57 AM and 09:29 AM UTC, Atlassian customers using Confluence Cloud couldn’t access their Confluence sites. The event was triggered by thread depletion in some of the GraphQL nodes in the Europe \\(Frankfurt\\) region. Our system automatically stopped sending requests to these unhealthy nodes but then overloaded the rest of the healthy nodes. The remaining nodes experienced high CPU, slow response time, and high error rates, which in turn rendered Confluence sites unresponsive.\n\nThe incident impacted customers in the Europe \\(Frankfurt\\) region. It was detected within seven minutes by the GraphQL high CPU detection system and mitigated by aggressively scaling up the service in that region, which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was 32 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was on January 20, 2023, between 08:57 AM UTC and 09:29 AM UTC for Confluence Cloud products. The incident caused service disruption to customers in the Europe \\(Frankfurt\\) region.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by thread pool depletion in some of Confluence’s GraphQL nodes. The thread pool depletion was triggered by a code change in GraphQL, which fetches authorization tokens from our authorization service using async threads meant to improve performance. Confluence’s GraphQL service recently switched to using a thread pool to handle all token fetch operations. During the incident, Confluence’s authorization service experienced spikes in new connections and returned timeout errors when the GraphQL service tried to fetch tokens. Since these fetches were executed in a thread pool, we ended up with thread pool depletion on our GraphQL service, making some of the nodes unresponsive.\n\nWhile our system automatically rotated the unhealthy nodes out of service and replaced them with new nodes, the ongoing traffic overloaded the remaining healthy nodes, which then rendered the remaining healthy nodes unresponsive.\n\nThe faulty service is a GraphQL gateway service to all Confluence Cloud API traffic. Since all the nodes were either not serving traffic or too overloaded to serve traffic, many of the GraphQL requests failed and rendered Confluence Cloud in the region inaccessible.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe appreciate outages impact your productivity and apologize to our partners and customers whose services were impacted during this incident. We are taking immediate steps to avoid a similar situation and improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nWhile we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place to avoid this type of situation, this specific issue was triggered only under particular load conditions when the authorization service fails to respond to token fetch requests and when the majority of the GraphQL nodes experience thread depletion.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following actions to avoid this type of incident in the future:\n\n* Turn off the async token fetch immediately\n* Look into faster automatic node replacement when nodes are unhealthy\n* Audit GraphQL and authorization services to confirm they can handle increasing loads in different regions\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn January 13, 2023, between 00:27 and 01:25 UTC, Atlassian customers using Confluence Cloud couldn’t access their Confluence sites. The event was triggered by a bug in the GraphQL service deploy script. The bug caused the script to fetch the wrong configuration file version, which is incompatible with the application code, and caused the service to fail when responding to all the incoming API requests with authentication errors.\n\nThe incident impacted customers in U.S. West \\(N. California\\), Europe \\(Frankfurt\\), and Asia Pacific \\(Singapore\\) regions. The incident was detected within 3 minutes by the frontend error detection system and mitigated by rolling back the last deployment of our GraphQL service, which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was 58 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between January 13, 2023, between 00:27am UTC and January 13, 2023, 01:25 AM UTC on Confluence Cloud products. The incident caused service disruption to customers in the U.S. West \\(N. California\\), Europe \\(Frankfurt\\), and Asia Pacific \\(Singapore\\) regions.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a bug in the GraphQL service deploy script. As a precaution, GraphQL service’s code changes have to be soaked in our staging environment before they are released to production. On the day of a production release, the GraphQL team will select a commit that has been soaked enough time to release.\n\nThere is a bug in the deploy script so that while the application source code is deployed per the commit the team chooses to release, the configuration file is fetched from the latest commit by the script. The latest configuration file change was incompatible with the application code and caused the service to fail when responding to all incoming API requests with authentication errors.\n\nThe faulty service is a GraphQL gateway service to all Confluence Cloud API traffic. Since it throws 401 errors for all the requests, all the GraphQL requests fail and hence render Confluence Cloud in the regions deployed inaccessible.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe appreciate outages impact your productivity. We apologize to our partners and customers whose services were impacted during this incident, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nWhile we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place to avoid this type of situation, this specific bug wasn’t discovered because it’s rare the service has a configuration file change that is not backward compatible with the code. A combination of the bug in the deploy script and the non-backward-compatible configuration file change caused this problem in production.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid this type of incident in the future:\n\n* Fix the bug in the deploy script so that the configuration file will be fetched together with the application code to ensure they are always compatible with each other\n* Update the on-call runbook and continue to train on-call engineers on how to perform a quick rollback on faulty service to minimize the incident time\n* Audit all the Confluence Cloud microservices to confirm every microservice deployed has the correct anomaly detection and progressive rollout setup\n\nFurthermore, we deploy our changes progressively \\(by percentage and each region\\) to avoid a broad impact but in this case, our error rate detection did not work as expected. To minimize the impact of breaking changes to our environments, we will implement additional preventative measures such as:\n\n* Bolster error detection mechanisms on the outer HTTP layer. We currently have error detector in the GraphQL layer but this time the request failed in the HTTP layer without reaching the GraphQL request handling. We need both types of detectors to cover different scenarios.\n* Bolster deployment validation to verify core functionalities of GraphQL during deployment so that deployment will be immediately halted and rolled back if the validation fails.\n\nThank you to your continued support.\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **CONTEXT**\n\nAtlassian Cloud products, applications, the customer experiences they provide, as well as supporting services and Atlassian’s own internal tooling rely on compute and data workloads deployed in Amazon Web Services \\(AWS\\) Virtual Private Cloud \\(VPC\\).\n\nCritical to the function of these applications is the network communication between them, as well as to the Internet and AWS-managed services. This communication depends on DNS resolution, which applications perform by querying a DNS server to translate service names into network addresses they can connect to.\n\nTo facilitate DNS resolution across multiple accounts and VPCs, Atlassian operates [centralized EC2 \\(Elastic Compute Cloud\\) DNS servers](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-centralize-dns-management-in-a-multi-account-environment/) in each AWS region we serve customers from.\n\nAtlassian is currently in the process of migrating from this centralized infrastructure to a more resilient distributed solution that leverages [AWS-managed VPC resolver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#AmazonDNS) in a [Shared VPC architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9NMA3ACZDM). However, a number of internal applications and services still rely on the EC2-based solution.\n\nThe EC2-based DNS servers utilize [security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html), which are subject to [connection tracking allowance limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html)instrumented by AWS.\n\n### **INCIDENT SUMMARY**\n\nOn November 22, 2022, between 19:39 and 21:28 UTC, some Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket customers experienced varying levels of degradation across our products and services, including partner apps and integrations. The incident was detected within nine minutes by an automated monitoring system and resolved within one hour and 49 minutes.\n\nThe event was triggered by Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure within the AWS us-east-1 region encountering a network connection tracking allowance limit. Despite the fault being localized to one region, there was a global impact for customers whose data resided in us-east-1, as well as Atlassian products which have unique dependencies on that region.\n\nThe issue was initially mitigated by scaling up the DNS infrastructure, which increased the connection tracking allowance limit and returned Atlassian products to a healthy state. The underlying issue has since been resolved by a configuration change and cannot reoccur.\n\nThe incident was not caused by an attack and it was not a security issue. Atlassian customer data remains secure.\n\nWe deeply value the trust placed in Atlassian and apologize to customers who were affected by the event.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe impact occurred on November 22, 2022, between 19:39 and 21:28 UTC, for a total of one hour and 49 minutes. Some Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket customers experienced service degradation ranging from intermittent access to a complete outage. Customers experienced error pages or very slow responses in applications and browsers, as well as 5xx response codes from our APIs.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe incident occurred as connections through Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure reached a new daily peak due to steady traffic growth. As a result, [a limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#connection-tracking-throttling) on the number of simultaneous network connections [tracked by an AWS EC2 security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html) was encountered. Upon reaching this limit, DNS packets were dropped, meaning services were unable to resolve network addresses which resulted in application failures. Services retried their DNS queries upon receiving a SERVFAIL response or query timeout, which created even more connections - compounding the problem.\n\nDuring the incident, Atlassian’s DNS infrastructure in the AWS us-east-1 region was unable to service up to 90% of DNS resolution requests.\n\nWe were not aware of how close our infrastructure was to the security group connection tracking limit because utilization of this allowance is not currently observable.\n\nTroubleshooting took an extended period of time because EC2 network allowance packet drops \\(as a result of encountering this limit\\) [were not actively monitored](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-network-performance-ena.html) by Atlassian.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nAtlassian acknowledges that outages like this one impact the productivity and business of our customers. Since this incident:\n\n* We have deployed an immediate change to prevent traffic through Atlassian’s EC2-based DNS infrastructure from [consuming the security group connection allowance limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#untracked-connections). As a result of this change, this incident cannot reoccur.\n* We are investigating ways to improve our visibility into the utilization of AWS network allowance limits and will [monitor packet drops](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-network-performance-ena.html) due to them. \n* We are continuing our migration of internal services away from the EC2-based DNS infrastructure involved in this incident to a new, distributed architecture that is not subject to these network limits.\n\nAgain, we apologize to those customers whose services were impacted during this incident.\n\nThank you,  \nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn NOV 7, 2022 between 8:10 AM and 7:26 PM UTC, Atlassian customers using Confluence experienced degraded performance. The event was triggered by database migrations which impacted customers in a single database instance in the European region. The incident was detected within 28 minutes by Atlassian’s internal automated monitoring system system and mitigated by scaling the database instance size which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 11 hours and 16 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nSome customer database instances were over provisioned and experienced intermittent slow performance, request timeouts, and complete downtime.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by database migrations performed for maintenance operation. The migration resulted in over provisioning and caused database CPU to spike to 100%. The CPU spike resulted in degraded performance for Confluence.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified earlier because modeling customer usage is nuanced and even slight error in modeling will result in over provisioning or under provisioning.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Adding more metrics used in customer usage modeling.\n* Improving automated tenant rebalancing to avoid over provisioning or under provisioning.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
