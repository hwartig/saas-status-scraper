Recovery of affected Atlassian services occurred on a product-by-product basis with full recovery for all products completed by September 19 2023 04:15 AM UTC.\n\n‌\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nProduct impact varied based on which regions and availability zones services are using, with services hosted in us-west-2 being affected more than services hosted in us-east-1.  \n\nProduct-specific impacts are listed below:\n\n* **Jira Software -** A number of Jira nodes were affected with highly elevated error rates due to Jira databases in us-east-1 and us-west-2 being impacted.  The impact was varied with some Jira nodes being unusable whilst others were in a usable but degraded state.\n* **Jira Service Management -** Some users hosted in us-east-1 and us-west-2 experienced problems when creating issues through the Help Center, viewing issues, transitioning issues, posting comments and using queues\n* **Jira Work Management -** Users based in us-west-2 experienced minor service degradation.\n* **Jira Product Discovery -** Users experienced some issues when loading insights.\n* **Confluence Cloud -** Impact was limited to customers hosted in the us-west-2 region. During this time, users attempting to load confluence pages experienced sporadic product degradation, including brief periods where Confluence was inaccessible, complete and partial page load failures, page timeouts, increased request latency.\n* **Trello -** Users had minimal service degradation - only 0.1% of Trello users had automation rules impacted.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe root cause was an issue with subsystem responsible for network mapping propagation within the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud in the us-east-1 \\(use1-az1\\) and us-west-2 \\(usw2-az1 and usw2-az2\\) regions, which impacted network connectivity for multiple AWS services which Atlassian products rely upon.\n\nThere was a delay between the AWS incident and Atlassian being affected as existing compute instances and resources were not affected by the issue. However any changes to networking state - such as scaling-up with additional compute nodes - experienced delays in the propagation of network mappings. This led to network connectivity issues until these network mappings had been fully propagated. Other AWS services that create or modify networking resources also saw impact as a result of this issue.\n\nThere were no relevant Atlassian-driven events in the lead-up that have been identified to cause or contribute to this incident.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nTo avoid repeating this type of incident, we are prioritizing documenting and evaluating ways to improve Availability Zone failure resiliency.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Although the incident was detected within one minute by our monitoring system, this issue led to the degradation of the scaling capabilities of our internal hosting platform, resulting in service degradation or outages for customers of Atlassian cloud products.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThis incident affected multiple regions and products, due to the diminished scaling capabilities of our internal hosting platform. Customers using Atlassian cloud products faced reduced functionality, slower response times, and limited access to specific features.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe root cause of this incident was unexpected behavior in a third-party tool that functions as our internal artifact management system. The issue made it impossible for our artifact management system to scale to demand, and as a result, our internal hosting platform was unable to scale effectively.\n\nUpon identifying and localizing the problem, we corrected the issue and were able to restore full scaling capabilities to our artifact management system, and by extension, our internal hosting platform.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nFollowing a previous incident of this nature \\([https://jira-software.status.atlassian.com/incidents/pqltf5m971qf](https://jira-software.status.atlassian.com/incidents/pqltf5m971qf)\\), we prioritized a project to ensure that such downtime does not negatively impact the ability to scale for our other components nor cause customer impact. While this work is now complete, it was not quite ready at the time this incident occurred.\n\nFurther, we committed to a temporary freeze on non-critical upgrades and changes for the artifact management system. This freeze has been maintained - the issue in this instance was not the result of a change or upgrade, but rather an unforeseen behavior in the system.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience caused by this incident and appreciate your understanding. Our team is dedicated to continually improving our systems and processes to provide you with the exceptional service you deserve. Thank you for your continued support and trust in us.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn Sep 13, 2023, between 12:00 PM UTC and 03: 30 PM UTC, some Atlassian users were unable to sign in to their accounts and use multiple Atlassian cloud products. The event was triggered by a misconfiguration of rate limits in an internal service which caused a cascading failure in sign-in and signup-related APIs. The incident was quickly detected by multiple automated monitoring systems. The incident was mitigated on Sep 13, 2023, 03: 30 PM UTC by the rollback of a feature and additional scaling of services which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 3 hours & 30 minutes.\n\n‌\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between Sep 13, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC and Sep 13, 2023, 03: 30 PM UTC on multiple products. The Incident caused intermittent service disruption across all regions. Some users were unable to sign in for sessions. Other scenarios that temporarily failed were new user signups, profile retrieval, and password reset. During the incident we had a peak of 90% requests failing across authentication, user profile retrieval, and password reset use cases.\n\n‌\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused due to a misconfiguration of a rate limit in an internal core service. As a result, some sign-in requests over the limit received HTTP 429 errors. However, retry behavior for requests caused a multiplication of load which led to higher service degradation. As many internal services depend on each other, the call graph complexity led to a longer time to detect the actual faulty service.\n\n‌\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are continuously improving our system's resiliency.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Audit and improve service rate limits and client retry and backoff behavior.\n* Improve scale and load test automation for complex service interactions.\n* Audit cross-service dependencies and minimize them where possible related to sign-in flows.\n\n‌\n\nDue to the unavailability of sign-in, some customers were unable to create support tickets. We are making additional process improvements to:\n\n* Enable our unauthenticated support contact form and notify users that it should be used when standard channels are not available.\n* Create status page notifications more quickly and ensure that for severe incidents, notifications to all subscribers are enabled.\n\n‌\n\nWe apologize to users who were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s reliability and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

Users with existing sessions were not impacted.\n\nBetween 5:32 and 6:00 UTC, traffic was incrementally restored to a previous build, mitigating the impact for users.\n\nThe total time to resolution was one hour and 53 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nUsers were not able to login using Atlassian's shared account management system \\([id.atlassian.com](http://id.atlassian.com)\\).\n\nThis affected users who were trying to login to the following products: Jira, Confluence, Trello, Opsgenie, mobile apps and ecosystem apps.\n\nAside from the inability to login, there was no impact on other Atlassian products or features.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nMultiple Set-Cookie headers were unintentionally modified so that only the last Set-Cookie header remained in the response to user's browsers.  The issue was caused by a change to Network Extensions within the Edge Network. As a result, users that needed a new session could not login.  Upon login, the users were redirected to login again and no session was created for them.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue was not detected in Atlassian's staging environment.  End-to-end tests did not cover the use case of multiple Set-Cookie headers in the single response and therefore this bug went unnoticed.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Automated tests to be put in place to validate that cookies are not being removed from responses.\n* Configuration of networking extensions will be guaranteed to be identical in staging and production to ensure errors are picked up earlier.\n\nFurthermore, we typically deploy our changes progressively by cloud region to avoid broad impact, but in this case, the change was not deemed risky and was deployed to all regions. To minimize the impact of breaking changes to our environments, we will implement additional preventative measures:\n\n* Changes to network extensions in the future will use progressive rollouts.\n* With staging being properly utilized, errors similar to this one will not be deployed to any production environments.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

The event was triggered by an issue with a new code deployment. The impacted customers were limited to the prod-east and prod-west2 regions. The incident was detected within 10 minutes of deployment by automatic monitoring systems, and mitigated by rolling back the deployment which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 2 hours and 42 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nIn Confluence Cloud, customers in the impacted regions may have experienced reduced functionality, slower response times, and limited access to initial loads of specific experiences including viewing of Confluence pages, space overview pages, and the home page.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a new code deployment. After identifying the problem, we quickly reverted the change to mitigate impact to customers.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. We are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Extending internal testing periods under load before being deployed to production environments  \n* Enhancing automated post-deployment anomaly detection of platform health\n* Optimizing automatic rollback of new deployments that fail automated health checks\n* Enabling further internal automated production fallbacks to ensure reliability at all times\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

On July 6, 2023, from 03:52 to 15:11 UTC, we experienced an issue with an upgraded version of a third-party tool that functions as our internal artifact management system. Despite our monitoring system identifying the incident within two minutes, this issue led to the degradation of the scaling capabilities of our internal hosting platform, resulting in service degradation or outages for customers of Atlassian cloud.\n\nIn response to this situation, we are taking immediate measures to enhance the stability of our system and prevent similar issues from re-occurring.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThis incident affected multiple regions and products due to the diminished scaling capabilities of our internal hosting platform. In most products and offerings, customers faced reduced functionality, slower response times, and limited access to specific features.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe root cause of the incident was the introduction of new functionality in a third-party tool that functions as our internal artifact management system. It led to an unexpected increase in the load on the primary database of the artifact system.\n\nUpon identifying and localizing the problem, we promptly adjusted the system configuration to regain stability.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nOver the next months, we will enact a temporary freeze on non-critical upgrades of the artifact management system, and we will focus our efforts on three high-priority initiatives:\n\n1. **Enhancing system scaling:** We prioritized work ensuring that downtime in a critical infrastructure component does not affect the scaling of other components. We expect to complete this initiative within the next two months.\n2. **Reducing interdependencies:** We are working to mitigate the risk of potential cascading failures by ensuring that significant system components are able to operate independently in the case of issues. Initiatives 1 and 2 are already in progress but have been given priority to be completed as soon as possible.\n3. **Strengthening testing procedures:** Alongside these initiatives, we are addressing the need for even more stringent testing procedures than we already have in place to prevent potential issues in future updates. We are committed to collaborating closely with our technology partners to ensure the most optimal experience for our customers.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience caused by this incident and appreciate your understanding. Our team is dedicated to continually improving our systems and processes to provide you with the exceptional service you deserve. Thank you for your continued support and trust in us.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn June 28 2023 at 17:38 UTC, a subset of Atlassian customers using Confluence were unable to access the product. The event was triggered by a continuous verification system that erroneously shut down a database due to the incorrect logic related to Bring Your Own Key \\(BYOK\\). This incident affected some customers who had their database hosted in the US West region. The incident was detected in 46 minutes by customer support responding to support tickets and mitigated by restarting the stopped database which restored access to Confluence tenants. The total time to resolution was about one hour and 51 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was limited to June 28th, 2023 between 17:38 and 19:29 UTC for Confluence customers. The incident caused service disruption to the customers hosted in the US West region who are served by the database that was incorrectly shut down. Users accessing the site saw a page stating \"We'll be back in a flash.\" There was no impact on data integrity and only access was lost during the incident period. \n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by a change made to a continuous verification system for a service related to BYOK. More specifically, the continuous verification system runs checks to ensure that Atlassian is able to respond to BYOK customers who choose to revoke key access. In response to a key being revoked, we stop the databases for those customers in order to gracefully suspend the operation of the site. The root cause of the incident was a bug in the logic that identifies a BYOK database to be stopped and a lack of guardrails to ensure the database being stopped corresponds to a revoking customer.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Restrict the database actions by our continuous verification system to only BYOK-enabled databases.\n\nFurthermore, we deploy our changes progressively to avoid broad impact but in this case, our pre-production verification did not work as expected. To minimize the impact of breaking changes to our environments, we will implement additional preventative measures such as:\n\n* Expanded coverage of cases covered in pre-production environments, and\n* Improve monitoring to alert on unexpected database actions.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn JUN 14, 2023, between 18:55 and 19:50 UTC, Atlassian customers using Confluence may not have been able to access their Confluence site. The event was triggered by a name change made to an infrastructural service which Confluence uses for monitoring, which impacted customers in US regions \\(prod-west2 and prod-east\\). The incident was detected within 10 minutes by monitoring and mitigated by scaling up the Confluence API gateway, as well as reverting the renaming of the infrastructural service. This put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about 55 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nBetween June 14, 2023 18:55 and June 14, 2023 19:50 UTC, Confluence customers in the US East and West regions may have not been able to access their Confluence sites. This impact did not extend to all Confluence sites or users on a given site, as the nature of the issue meant that some users requests to their site may have succeeded, while others failed.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThis incident was caused by a name change to an infrastructural service that Confluence uses for monitoring purposes. This service is normally invoked by Confluence's gateway on every web request which is received. However when the infrastructural service’s name was updated, a new failure mode was induced in the Confluence gateway service, which in turn began a memory leak. Under high load, Confluence’s gateway hosts experienced an out of memory condition which caused the service degradation encountered during this incident.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe know that outages impact your productivity. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified because:\n\n* There were naming convention challenges and internal team miscommunication during the rollout of the name change to the infrastructural service.\n* The infrastructural service which was renamed does not directly provide customer functionality, and is only used internally by engineers for monitoring. As such, while tests do exist for this code, they do not check for name changes such as what occurred in this outage.\n* The fault wasn’t detected in our staging environment because when the load was low, the memory leak was very slow, and when the load was higher, active load testing masked node failures.\n* The Confluence gateway code which invokes the infrastructural service was not resilient to a potential naming change, and was not using environmental variables.\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* The Confluence gateway service will adopt the recommended practice to use environmental variables when invoking infrastructural services.\n* The Confluence gateway service will make the relevant code more robust to ensure the system can bypass this non-critical path infrastructure service if it is not available generally.\n* We will implement checks when the Confluence gateway service is deployed to fail at deploy time if a key dependency cannot be invoked \\(by a specific name or otherwise\\).\n* Our infrastructure team will perform additional verification checks when decommissioning production infrastructure to ensure it isn't still being actively used by critical workloads.\n\nFurthermore, to minimize the impact of breaking changes to our environments, we will implement additional detection measures such as:\n\n* We will improve monitoring and alerts in our staging environment for Confluence's gateway service. While we do have alerts in production which fired properly, we will enable them for staging and reduce lag time between the event firing and alerts being generated in staging.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn June 13 2023, from 6:49 PM UTC to June 14, 2023, 02:20 AM UTC, Atlassian customers using Jira Software, Jira Service Management, Jira Work Management, Confluence and Trello with services hosted in AWS us-east-1 region were impacted by Automation rule degradation. This event was triggered by an increased error rates and latencies for AWS Lambda function invocations in the us-east-1 region. Some other AWS services also experienced increased error rates and latencies as a result of degraded Lambda functions invocations.  This incident was automatically detected by multiple monitoring systems within 6 minutes, paging on-call teams. Recovery of the affected AWS Lambda service began after 116 minutes at June 13th 8:45 PM UTC.  Full recovery of all AWS services occurred at 10:37 PM UTC June 13th after the backlog of asynchronous Lambda events had been processed. Some Jira tenants with large event backlogs experienced delays in running schedule-based rule reruns. Full recovery of all Atlassian Cloud services was notified at June 14, 2023, 02:20 AM UTC.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe overall impact was between June 13, 2023, 06:49 PM UTC and June 14, 2023, 02:20 AM UTC.  Product-specific impacts are listed below.\n\n* Jira Software, Jira Service Management,  Jira Work Management - Automation rules were not executed for 2 hours between Jun 13, 06:49 PM UTC and Jun 13, 08:45 PM UTC.  Jira automation events generated during this period were unable to be rerun.  When AWS Lambda recovered delays were still experienced in our schedule-based and event-based rules for some larger tenants due to a large backlog of events. Full recovery was at June 14, 2023, 02:20 AM UTC.\n* Confluence - Automation rules were not executed for 2 hours between Jun 13, 06:49 PM UTC and Jun 13, 08:45 PM UTC.  On AWS service restoration Confluence automation recovered and Confluence automation events generated during this period were rerun and processed.  Full recovery was at June 14, 2023, 12:41 AM UTC.\n* Jira Product Discovery - Automation rules were not executed for 2 hours between Jun 13, 06:49 PM UTC and Jun 13, 08:45 PM UTC. Jira automation events generated during this period were unable to be rerun.  Sending feedback/filing a support ticket from the application did not work. \n* Trello -  Email to board delays, card covers image upload failures, attachment preview generation failures, board background upload failures, custom sticker images upload failures, custom emoji upload failures. Trello automation was unaffected. Full recovery was at June 13, 2023, 10:08 PM UTC.\n\nThe service disruption lasted for 7 hours and 1 minutes between June 13, 2023, 06:49 PM UTC and June 14, 2023, 02:20 AM UTC and caused service disruption to customers with services hosted in the US-EAST-1 region.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nAtlassian uses Amazon Web Services \\(AWS\\) as a cloud service provider. The root cause was an issue with a subsystem responsible for capacity management for AWS Lambda in US-EAST-1 Region, which also impacted 104 AWS services.  This impacted Automation rules as the service is hosted exclusively in this region.\n\nThere were no relevant Atlassian-driven events in the lead-up that have been identified to cause or contribute to this incident.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Increase reliability of message delivery and recoverability from Jira to Automation platform to improve recovery times. \n* Create a plan for multi-region impact mitigation for Automation.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",

          "body": "### **SUMMARY**\n\nOn May 15, 2023, between 02:36 and 04:08 UTC, Atlassian customers using Bitbucket, Confluence, Jira Align, Jira Service Management, Jira Software, Jira Work Management, Jira Product Discovery, and Atlas products with services hosted in the us-west-1 region were impacted by an incident related to the storing and retrieval of data assets, including media, attachments and build artifacts.\n\nThe event was triggered by a network migration of an internal service as part of an initiative to increase security by hardening partitions between network segments. The incident was detected within three minutes by automated monitoring and mitigated by a rollback of the change which put Atlassian systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour and 32 minutes.\n\n### **IMPACT**\n\nThe impact across products was:\n\n* Bitbucket - Bitbucket Pipelines self-hosted builds were failing, access to Git LFS failed and cloud-hosted builds were delayed.\n* Confluence, Jira Align, Jira Service Management, Jira Software, Jira Work Management, Jira Product Discovery, and Atlas - media capabilities \\(images, videos, documents, audio\\) were affected and it was not possible to upload, download or view existing media attachments or files.\n\nThe service disruption lasted for one hour and 32 minutes between May 15, 2023, 02:36 and May 15, 2023, 04:08 UTC and caused service disruption to customers with services hosted in the us-west-1 region.\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE**\n\nThe issue was caused by an attempted migration of a service to a new network segment. As part of this migration, a DNS record pointing to the old network segment was not updated, which resulted in failure when the old network stack was removed. While we have a number of testing and preventative processes in place, this specific issue wasn’t identified as moving services across network segments is not a regular activity and is difficult to accurately replicate in a test environment. To mitigate against these types of issues, we made this change using blue/green deployment practices but failed to run adequate verification steps before decommissioning the old stack.\n\n### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**\n\nWe are prioritizing the following improvement actions to avoid repeating this type of incident:\n\n* Reviewing our systems that decommission service stacks and implementing checks that customer traffic is no longer being served prior to decommissioning the stacks; and\n* As part of our service network migration process, we are adding steps to identify when there are associated DNS records that require attention.\n\nWe apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n\nThanks,\n\nAtlassian Customer Support",
