Specifically, the issue is preventing the Google “Transfer All Drive Files” Action from completing as expected, and is delaying the subsequent actions in the impacted workflows as a result. At the moment, we're working to determine root cause, and we've asked our partners at Google to look into a potential issue; however, we are working to mitigate the impact on our customers.
