The root cause was an added dependency which impacted client-side rendering of Pages. This issue was not immediately detected by automated tests or monitors.\n\nFrom `20:27Z` to `21:11Z`, our oncall team activated a recovery system allowing Pages served on the `bit.ly` domain to recover. Some custom domains continued to see impact. The code change contributing to the outage was identified and rolled back allowing for full recovery of Page rendering.\n\nWe have already taken steps in our automation to detect similar rendering problems before they can affect our customers. We apologize for the inconvenience this outage may have caused and understand the impact to our customers. We place a high value on the reliability of our services and are evaluating ways to improve our ability to mitigate this type of issue. We also understand the impact and potential confusion caused by the lack of messaging during this outage. We value highly and will work to improve our ability to communicate about incidents in a timely fashion.",

The root cause was a failure in our deployment pipeline which caused the incorrect release to be deployed. This change was immediately detected and rolled back but the failure triggered an unknown dependency loop which required a manual rollback to restore some systems. We have already taken steps to resolve some root causes and are evaluating ways to improve our ability to rollback more quickly in similar situations.",

From `04:56 UTC` to `06:26 UTC` we experienced intermittent but significant impact to the Bitly website, Link-in-Bio pages, and redirects for custom domains with DNS A records. Some custom domains continued to see impact until `19:51 UTC` when we released additional updates to our mitigation strategy. The Bitly API and links on the bit.ly domain and custom domains with DNS CNAME records continued to work throughout this period.\n\nAdditionally, during this incident our status page provider was conducting a maintenance window and experienced an outage of its own which affected our ability to communicate our investigation and response to this incident via status.bitly.com in a timely manner. At `05:55 UTC` we were able to update bitly.com with some details of our incident response.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this outage may have caused and understand the impact to our customers. We place a high value on the reliability of our services and are evaluating ways to improve our ability to mitigate this type of issue. We also understand the impact and potential confusion caused by the lack of messaging during this outage. We value highly and will work to improve our ability to communicate about incidents in a timely fashion.",
