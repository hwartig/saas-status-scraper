Our systems are now stable and functioning optimally. \n\nImpact:\n\nAs a result of this issue, some users of pay-per-result Actors were charged more than they should have paid if the run was running during one of the following intervals:\n- 2024/07/03 15-17 UTC\n- 2024/07/04 04-06 UTC\n\nWe are currently investigating the full scope of this issue and will issue refunds to affected users within the next week. Based on our initial assessment, the number of impacted users is limited.\n\nFuture Prevention:\n\nOver the coming week, our team will prioritize implementing more measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. We consider this issue a high-severity matter and are committed to ensuring the continued reliability of our services.\n\nWe sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this caused.",
