It started as a small-scale issue, and the problem escalated after 14:00 UTC.\n* From 15:00 UTC to 15:55 UTC, API performance was degraded, and some Actor builds and runs were stuck in the READY state. Some Actor runs were aborted but can be resurrected.\n* From 15:25 UTC to 16:15 UTC, schedules were not working, so some Actor runs did not start at all.\n\nWhat happened?\n\n* We implemented a change that would improve Actor startup performance by targeting Docker layers more effectively.\n* The change caused certain database items to increase in size, overloading the network of the primary cluster and leading to degraded performance.\n* Some core components, including those behind the scheduler, repeatedly went out of memory.\n\nWhat we did\n\n* We temporarily paused the Actor run scheduler and manually aborted runs triggered after 15:00 UTC.\n* We downscaled the platform to make the database responsive again and reverted the change causing the bug.\n\nNext steps\n\n* We will improve our monitoring to catch similar problems, deviations, and network spikes sooner before they escalate.\n* We will investigate the component's current architecture to ensure we prevent such incidents in the future. \n\nWe apologize for the disruption and appreciate your patience.

By 16.15 UTC, the issue was resolved.\n\nImpact:\n - During the incident, some scheduled Actors did not start or were run twice.\n - In response, we've aborted some of the runs that started after 15:00 UTC and turned off the Schedule component for approximately 45 minutes.\n - If your runs were aborted, they can now be safely resurrected; see: https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/runs-and-builds#resurrection-of-finished-run\n - There was no data loss for runs in progress, but some runs were not triggered.\n - API performance was degraded at various levels along the incident, and some runs started via API may have been in a READY state for longer than usual.\n\nWe're sorry for the inconvenience. We take this issue seriously and will implement measures to mitigate similar issues in the future.\nWe will provide a post-mortem summary here with more details later this week.",
