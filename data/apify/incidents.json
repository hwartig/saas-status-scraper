A suboptimal DB query used in our job allocator overloaded the CPU of the database kernel, and our central database slowed down under the critical value, which caused a cascade effect.\n* After we recovered the system, the buffer used for our dataset API did not fully recover, which caused the performance issues of the dataset API endpoint that persisted until the full recovery.\n\n**Next steps and new measures**\n\n* We discovered the suboptimal query caused the database to be overloaded. This is fixed at the time of writing. We plan to publish an engineering blog post on this topic.\n* We also found the bottleneck that protected dataset API from an automated recovery, and the fix is in progress.\n* We are currently analyzing and testing other system components to ensure that they are elastic enough.\n* We will apply new platform measures and limits to beware of the original trigger of the incident. These limits will affect no users, but they are strict enough to protect workloads from accidental overload.\n\nWe are sorry for any inconvenience and problems caused by this incident.",

This caused runs to be on hold, and only the runs with a short timeout may have timed out.\n- Thanks to the recovery process, we prevented a potential data loss.\n\nThis incident is unrelated to the previous one, and the root cause is different. We consider this an incident of critical severity, and we will update you next week with detailed information on the root cause and our measures to prevent these problems in the future.",

Unfortunately, the newly implemented alerting mechanism failed and the actors were slowed down at various levels during the past about 10 hours.\n\nThe recovery mechanism did work and we quickly recovered. Everything now works at a normal speed.\n\nAffect on users:\n- Many of the actors running between about 00:00 and 10:15 GMT+1 have been running slower than usual.\n- This mainly affects the short-running actors as these are likely to time out.\n- The actual reason for the slowdown is a high error rate resulting in a higher number of API call retries. The high number of retries are caused by network problems.\n\nWe finally collected enough data and worked on a long-term solution. We apologize for any inconvenience caused and will update you on the progress shortly.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate (2022/08/02 19:07 GMT+1): We are still working on a final solution but have a recovery system in place to beware of this recurrence of this issue .",
