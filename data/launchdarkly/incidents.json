Some customers may need to update the IP allowlists in their firewalls or proxy servers to ensure that their services can continue establishing streaming connections from server-side SDKs to LaunchDarkly without disruption. Approximately 88% of traffic to stream.launchdarkly.com will continue to be routed to existing stable IPs.\n\nWe are working with AWS to provide a list of additional stable IPs and will post another update as soon as they become available.\n\nWe will continue to actively monitor our services and provide updates if anything changes.\n\nWe recommend that customers who switched from streaming to polling mode as a workaround remain in polling mode for now. We will continue to provide updates to this recommendation.\n\nWe’ll provide another update within 60 minutes.",
