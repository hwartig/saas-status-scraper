We apologize for the inconvenience, and we have rolled back larger accounts to the previous version for the time being. We have confirmed that the issue has been resolved completely and all systems are 100% operational at this time.\n\nFor any Insight Center accounts which were not rolled back and that lost temporarily access to real-time and analytics, your admin will need to assign a Supervisor role and Agent role to take advantage of the new GoTo Contact Complete experience.
