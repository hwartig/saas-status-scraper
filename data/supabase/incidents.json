          "body": "Between September 2nd and September 20th, 2025, customers in the UAE experienced service outages when attempting to access Supabase projects. The issue was caused by DNS-level blocking implemented by major UAE telecommunications providers Etisalat and Du, citing copyright infringement concerns related to unauthorized usage of our platform.\n\nCustomers with projects accessed from within the UAE were completely unable to reach any `*.supabase.co` domains. The blocking affected all Supabase services including PostgREST, Auth, Storage, Realtime, and Edge Functions.\n\nWe sincerely apologize for the extended disruption this caused to your applications and services. Here is additional detail about what happened and the steps we're taking to prevent similar incidents.\n\n## What happened?\n\nUAE telecommunications providers Etisalat and Du implemented DNS-level blocking of all `*.supabase.co` domains after identifying a project that violated broadcasting rights in the region. The providers did not send advance notice or DMCA takedown requests, instead implementing immediate network-wide blocking for all Supabase domains.\n\nThe incident timeline was as follows:\n\n* **MON 2 SEP 18:00 UTC**: Initial customer reports of connectivity issues from UAE\n* **MON 2 SEP 23:30 UTC**: Identified DNS blocking by Etisalat, began outreach attempts\n* **TUE 3 to FRI 13 SEP**: Sent multiple formal and informal communications to ISP NOC contacts\n* **WED 10 SEP**: Deployed proxy workaround with limited functionality as last resort measure\n* **SUN 15 SEP**: Our partners were able to reach out directly to Etisalat and worked with them to facilitate unblock\n* **SUN 15 SEP**: Engaged UAE law firm to handle official TDRA communication\n* **MON 16 SEP**: Our customer facilitated introduction to TDRA\n* **TUE 17 SEP**: Etisalat connectivity restored following TDRA intervention\n* **WED 18 SEP**: TDRA provided details of copyright violations, offending project suspended\n* **THU 19 SEP**: Du confirmed working on removal of restrictions\n* **FRI 20 SEP**: Full connectivity restored across all UAE ISPs\n\n## What will we do to mitigate problems like this in the future?\n\n* We have established forward looking proactive strategy with government authorities in the UAE.\n* We are working on a strategy for further proactive regulator engagement.\n* Make abuse reporting channels more visible on our website.\n\n## What actions do you need to take?\n\nIf you previously switched to a proxy as a workaround, please migrate back to your original `*.supabase.co` domain as the proxy solution has limited functionality and is not intended for long-term use.\n\nIf you experience any lingering connectivity issues from UAE networks, please contact our support team with your project details and ISP information.",

          "body": "## SSL Handshake Failures Due to BGP Route Leak\n\nBetween 9:15 UTC and 11:09 UTC on August 28th, 2025, customers accessing Supabase services in the us-east-1 region experienced SSL handshake failures \\(525 errors\\) when connecting to their projects. The issue was caused by a third-party network route leak that misdirected traffic intended for AWS prefixes.\n\nCustomers with projects hosted in the us-east-1 region were primarily affected. In total, over 5 million requests were blocked. The impacted requests received Cloudflare 525 and 520 errors, primarily affecting PostgREST and Auth services.\n\nWe sincerely apologize for the disruption this caused to your applications and services. Here is additional detail about what happened and the steps we're taking to improve our resilience against similar incidents.\n\n### What happened?\n\nA third-party network provider unintentionally propagated BGP routing announcements beyond their intended scope, causing a route leak that included AWS prefixes used by Supabase origins. This misdirected traffic away from its proper destination, resulting in SSL handshake failures at our CDN layer.\n\nThe incident timeline was as follows:\n\n* WED 28 AUG 9:18 UTC: Multiple customer in us-east support tickets reported 525 and 520 errors\n* WED 28 AUG 9:20 UTC: We started an internal incident\n* WED 28 AUG 9:25 UTC: Our team identified the issue was concentrated in us-east-1 region and reached out to our upstream provider\n* WED 28 AUG 9:50 UTC: Issue was confirmed to be related to external network/CDN problem\n* WED 28 AUG 10:35 UTC: US traffic began recovering as BGP routes stabilized\n* WED 28 AUG 11:09 UTC: Full recovery confirmed, error rates returned to zero\n* WED 29 AUG 9:40 UTC: We were continuing to work with an upstream provider until the identification of the root cause\n\n### What will we do to mitigate problems like this in the future?\n\n* Improve detection and alerting\n* Improve vendor communication to be able to faster detect similar issues in the future\n\n### What actions do you need to take?\n\nNo action is required from customers. This was an infrastructure issue outside of Supabase's direct control that has been resolved. The BGP route leak was corrected by the third-party network provider, and traffic routing has returned to normal.\n\nIf you continue to experience connectivity issues, please contact our support team with details about your specific project and region.",

          "body": "## Incident Summary\n\n**Date:** 2025-06-12\n\n**Service Impacted:** Supabase Platform \\(Multiple Services\\)\n\n**Affected Region\\(s\\):** Global\n\n**Duration:** ~2 hours 25 minutes \\(18:05–20:30 UTC\\)\n\nBetween 18:05 UTC and 20:30 UTC on June 12, 2025, Supabase services experienced widespread degradation caused by an outage in our upstream provider’s infrastructure. The outage impacted the majority of HTTP and Websocket traffic to Supabase APIs globally.\n\nDirect Postgres and connection pooler access remained unaffected.\n\n### Who was affected?\n\n* All Supabase users interacting with the platform or projects via HTTP or WebSocket, including:\n\n    * Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, and Data APIs \\(via API Gateway\\)\n    * Dashboard operations \\(partial functionality\\)\n    * Realtime/WebSocket connections\n    * Logging and observability\n    \n\n### What happened?\n\nSupabase relies on the upstream provider for proxying, DNS and routing across our platform services and user projects. On June 12, a bug in their Cloud Provider’s infrastructure caused Workers KV storage to fail cascading across their systems.\n\nThis caused Supabase’s API Gateway to stop responding, leading to major service degradation as it is an entry point for the vast majority of HTTP and WebSocket traffic.\n\n**Incident timeline \\(UTC\\):**\n\n* **18:17** — Internal alert triggered: HTTP APIs, Dashboard, WebSocket traffic degraded.\n* **18:28** — Incident declared. Logging in into our provider dashboard wasn't working, we opened a support ticket with them and started a conversation about the root cause and ETA for the fix.\n* **18:36** — We observe timeouts from the Management API globally.\n* **18:45–19:05** — Spike of Management API requests affected internal middleware DB, we took measures to return it to healthy state.\n* **19:05–19:13** — Trialled bypass proxy mitigation.\n* **20:09** — Provider systems began recovering.\n* **20:20** — We retried platform operations that failed during downtime.\n* **20:30** — Supabase services begin to stabilize as upstream infrastructure recovers.\n* **21:18** — Supabase moves incident status to “Monitoring”.\n* **22:05** — Incident closed; services confirmed operational.\n\n### Why did it happen?\n\n* The root cause was an issue within the infrastructure of Cloudflare’s upstream cloud provider.\n* This took down multiple their services, including KV which is a key service for them.\n* Supabase services affected due to heavy reliance on upstream provider:\n\n    * API Gateway failure blocked access to HTTP APIs and WebSocket.\n    * Management API and Dashboard affected due to proxy dependency and API Gateway dependency.\n    * Logflare degraded limiting observability due to the cloud provider issues.\n    \n\n### What did we do during the incident?\n\n* Opened support communications with Cloudflare immediately.\n* Coordinated response across teams and set up fallback comms channels.\n* Attempted mitigations while awaiting upstream recovery.\n* Paused billing exports and resumed after stability.\n* Recovered internal middleware systems affected by retry spikes.\n\n### What will we do to prevent this in future?\n\n1. Migrate critical services away from single points of failure in provider infrastructure.\n2. Continue work on API Gateway redesign for isolation and resilience.\n3. Improve logging and observability tooling to survive upstream outages.\n4. Update internal incident comms processes to reflect global outages accurately and quickly.\n5. Engage with the upstream provider for earlier notification of high-impact changes/issues.\n6. Tune circuit breakers and alerts for Management API and similar workloads.\n\n### What actions do users need to take?\n\nNo action required. This incident was caused by upstream infrastructure failure. All services have returned to normal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis was a serious outage that significantly impacted Supabase customers. While the root cause lay with our upstream provider, our own dependencies and architecture contributed to the extent of the disruption. We’ve identified concrete steps to mitigate future incidents, including reducing dependency on single infrastructure points and improving our internal and external communication during outages.\n\nWe’re grateful for the patience and understanding of our community and remain committed to building a more resilient and transparent platform.",
