          "body": "## Incident Summary\n\n**Date:** 2025-06-12\n\n**Service Impacted:** Supabase Platform \\(Multiple Services\\)\n\n**Affected Region\\(s\\):** Global\n\n**Duration:** ~2 hours 25 minutes \\(18:05–20:30 UTC\\)\n\nBetween 18:05 UTC and 20:30 UTC on June 12, 2025, Supabase services experienced widespread degradation caused by an outage in our upstream provider’s infrastructure. The outage impacted the majority of HTTP and Websocket traffic to Supabase APIs globally.\n\nDirect Postgres and connection pooler access remained unaffected.\n\n### Who was affected?\n\n* All Supabase users interacting with the platform or projects via HTTP or WebSocket, including:\n\n    * Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, and Data APIs \\(via API Gateway\\)\n    * Dashboard operations \\(partial functionality\\)\n    * Realtime/WebSocket connections\n    * Logging and observability\n    \n\n### What happened?\n\nSupabase relies on the upstream provider for proxying, DNS and routing across our platform services and user projects. On June 12, a bug in their Cloud Provider’s infrastructure caused Workers KV storage to fail cascading across their systems.\n\nThis caused Supabase’s API Gateway to stop responding, leading to major service degradation as it is an entry point for the vast majority of HTTP and WebSocket traffic.\n\n**Incident timeline \\(UTC\\):**\n\n* **18:17** — Internal alert triggered: HTTP APIs, Dashboard, WebSocket traffic degraded.\n* **18:28** — Incident declared. Logging in into our provider dashboard wasn't working, we opened a support ticket with them and started a conversation about the root cause and ETA for the fix.\n* **18:36** — We observe timeouts from the Management API globally.\n* **18:45–19:05** — Spike of Management API requests affected internal middleware DB, we took measures to return it to healthy state.\n* **19:05–19:13** — Trialled bypass proxy mitigation.\n* **20:09** — Provider systems began recovering.\n* **20:20** — We retried platform operations that failed during downtime.\n* **20:30** — Supabase services begin to stabilize as upstream infrastructure recovers.\n* **21:18** — Supabase moves incident status to “Monitoring”.\n* **22:05** — Incident closed; services confirmed operational.\n\n### Why did it happen?\n\n* The root cause was an issue within the infrastructure of Cloudflare’s upstream cloud provider.\n* This took down multiple their services, including KV which is a key service for them.\n* Supabase services affected due to heavy reliance on upstream provider:\n\n    * API Gateway failure blocked access to HTTP APIs and WebSocket.\n    * Management API and Dashboard affected due to proxy dependency and API Gateway dependency.\n    * Logflare degraded limiting observability due to the cloud provider issues.\n    \n\n### What did we do during the incident?\n\n* Opened support communications with Cloudflare immediately.\n* Coordinated response across teams and set up fallback comms channels.\n* Attempted mitigations while awaiting upstream recovery.\n* Paused billing exports and resumed after stability.\n* Recovered internal middleware systems affected by retry spikes.\n\n### What will we do to prevent this in future?\n\n1. Migrate critical services away from single points of failure in provider infrastructure.\n2. Continue work on API Gateway redesign for isolation and resilience.\n3. Improve logging and observability tooling to survive upstream outages.\n4. Update internal incident comms processes to reflect global outages accurately and quickly.\n5. Engage with the upstream provider for earlier notification of high-impact changes/issues.\n6. Tune circuit breakers and alerts for Management API and similar workloads.\n\n### What actions do users need to take?\n\nNo action required. This incident was caused by upstream infrastructure failure. All services have returned to normal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis was a serious outage that significantly impacted Supabase customers. While the root cause lay with our upstream provider, our own dependencies and architecture contributed to the extent of the disruption. We’ve identified concrete steps to mitigate future incidents, including reducing dependency on single infrastructure points and improving our internal and external communication during outages.\n\nWe’re grateful for the patience and understanding of our community and remain committed to building a more resilient and transparent platform.",

          "body": "Between 16:02 UTC and 17:15 UTC on March 22nd 2025, customers who were accessing Supabase services from Next.js middleware had their Supabase requests blocked by our upstream CDN provider.\n\nThe impacted requests received a “Sorry, you have been blocked” error response. The primary service impacted was Supabase Auth, as performing auth in Next.js middleware is a common and recommended usage pattern. A smaller number of requests to other Supabase services were also impacted.\n\nWe sincerely apologise for the negative effects our customers experienced. Here is some additional detail about what happened and what we will do to mitigate future outages of this nature.\n\n### Who was affected?\n\nCustomers who access Supabase services from Next.js middleware, or otherwise use a `x-middleware-subrequest` header were affected. In total, 9.59M requests were blocked across our customers endpoints.\n\n### What happened?\n\nOn March 21st 2025, Vercel/Next.js published a security advisory for [CVE-2025-29927](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw), which allowed for Authorization Bypass in Next.js Middleware. In addition to advising customers to upgrade to a patched version of Next.js, the security advisory contained a workaround that noted “If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the `x-middleware-subrequest` header from reaching your Next.js application.”\n\nIn an effort to protect their customers from this CVE, our CDN provider [implemented a new managed WAF rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/2025-03-22-next-js-vulnerability-waf/) to block requests including the `x-middleware-subrequest` header, effectively implementing the suggested workaround for the CVE and rolled it out to their customers, which includes Supabase.\n\nThe incident timeline was as follows:\n\n* SAT 22 MAR 14:53 UTC: Our CDN provider posted in our shared slack channel informing us they were rolling out a patch for [CVE-2025-29927](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw) and that we would be the customer most impacted by this change. Slack is not monitored or part of our internal escalation mechanisms and our on-call engineers were not aware of the impending change.\n* SAT 22 MAR 16:02 UTC: The WAF rule was applied to the Supabase CDN.\n* SAT 22 MAR 16:09 UTC: We began to receive a high volume of customer reports indicating problems with the CDN blocking requests.\n* SAT 22 MAR 16:17 UTC: We declared an incident and response teams were paged and assembled.\n* SAT 22 MAR 17:07 UTC: We had identified the issue was related to the new WAF rule.\n* SAT 22 MAR 17:15 UTC: We worked with our CDN provider to disable the WAF rule.\n\nOnce the WAF rule was disabled, customers were once again able to use the `x-middleware-subrequest` header and the incident was resolved.\n\n### What will we do to mitigate problems like this in the future?\n\n1. During the incident, we discovered gaps with vendor relationships and we found it difficult to engage directly with our CDN provider. We have taken action to ensure that we have clearer methods of communication in the future for incidents that may impact our mutual customers.\n2. We have added alerting which will help us identify anomalies in the volume of customers requests that are blocked by our CDN provider, which will help us identify and resolve issues with harmful WAF rules faster in the future.\n3. We are investigating fallback CDN providers and other options for our CDN.\n\n### What actions do you need to take?\n\nAll customers using Next.js are encouraged to patch to the latest version if you are on a version that is affected by [CVE-2025-29927](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw).\n\nIf you are hosting your Next.js application with Vercel or Netlify you do not need to take any action as these platforms have built in protection from this CVE, however it is still a good idea to upgrade to a patched version of Next.js.\n\nIf you are hosting your Next.js application with a provider that is not Vercel or Netlify, we encourage you to urgently upgrade your application to a safe Next.js version as noted in the [Security Advisory](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw).",

The team scheduled a major upgrade to Supavisor 2.0 across 10 regions. The new version had already been successfully deployed in 9 smaller regions over the past few weeks, offering improvements in query latency and availability zone awareness.\n\n## Timeline of Events\n\n* **13:00 UTC** – Maintenance began, and Supavisor 2.0 was successfully deployed to 9 regions with minimal downtime, requiring only client connection restarts.\n* **14:46 UTC** – Deployment to `us-east-1` was completed successfully with clients reconnected and throughput stable. \n* **16:05 UTC** – A majority of clients disconnected and failed to reconnect reliably.\n* **16:11 UTC** – Incident was declared, and rollback initiated.\n* **16:53 UTC** – Rollback completed, restoring stability.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### Primary Cause\n\nThe failure stemmed from an ETS \\(Erlang Term Storage\\) table corruption, affecting critical components:\n\n* **16:05:50 UTC** – An `:ets.select_delete` operation failed, causing corruption.\n* **16:05:56 UTC** – Process registry lookups, backed by ETS, in `Syn` and `Cachex` libraries began failing and prevented tenants from reconnecting.\n* **16:06:00 UTC** – Processes managed by the affected process registry crashed, dropping connections for ~80% of tenants.\n\n## Resolution\n\n* Rollback to the previous Supavisor version was initiated.\n* The previous stable version restored normal operation.\n\n## Action Items\n\n* **Faster rollbacks** – Reduce rollback time from 40 minutes to under 90 seconds.\n* **Improved alerting** – Detect client disconnections within 2 minutes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe incident highlighted weaknesses in rollback speed and resiliency to unforeseen failures under load. Future improvements will focus on rollback efficiency to reduce the impact of similar deployment failures.",
