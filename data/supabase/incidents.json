The team scheduled a major upgrade to Supavisor 2.0 across 10 regions. The new version had already been successfully deployed in 9 smaller regions over the past few weeks, offering improvements in query latency and availability zone awareness.\n\n## Timeline of Events\n\n* **13:00 UTC** – Maintenance began, and Supavisor 2.0 was successfully deployed to 9 regions with minimal downtime, requiring only client connection restarts.\n* **14:46 UTC** – Deployment to `us-east-1` was completed successfully with clients reconnected and throughput stable. \n* **16:05 UTC** – A majority of clients disconnected and failed to reconnect reliably.\n* **16:11 UTC** – Incident was declared, and rollback initiated.\n* **16:53 UTC** – Rollback completed, restoring stability.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### Primary Cause\n\nThe failure stemmed from an ETS \\(Erlang Term Storage\\) table corruption, affecting critical components:\n\n* **16:05:50 UTC** – An `:ets.select_delete` operation failed, causing corruption.\n* **16:05:56 UTC** – Process registry lookups, backed by ETS, in `Syn` and `Cachex` libraries began failing and prevented tenants from reconnecting.\n* **16:06:00 UTC** – Processes managed by the affected process registry crashed, dropping connections for ~80% of tenants.\n\n## Resolution\n\n* Rollback to the previous Supavisor version was initiated.\n* The previous stable version restored normal operation.\n\n## Action Items\n\n* **Faster rollbacks** – Reduce rollback time from 40 minutes to under 90 seconds.\n* **Improved alerting** – Detect client disconnections within 2 minutes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe incident highlighted weaknesses in rollback speed and resiliency to unforeseen failures under load. Future improvements will focus on rollback efficiency to reduce the impact of similar deployment failures.",
